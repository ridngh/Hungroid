Whisk eggs with salt and pepper in a small bowl until frothy.

Melt 2 teaspoons butter in the nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour in beaten eggs; let cook for 30 seconds. Lift the edges of the omelet so that the uncooked egg runs under the cooked edges and comes into contact with the hot skillet. Shake and tilt the skillet to move the uncooked egg. Repeat until the top is set, about 3 minutes; reduce heat to low.

Meanwhile, chop bacon roughly; sprinkle over omelet. Sprinkle with cheese; allow cheese to melt, 1 to 2 minutes.

Meanwhile, butter 2 slices of bread with 1/2 teaspoon butter each. Lay bread, buttered side up, side-by-side over omelet, leaving about 1 inch between slices. The melted cheese will help the bread adhere.

Run a spatula around the entire omelet to loosen from the skillet. Carefully turn the omelet over so buttered side of bread is in contact with the skillet. Cook until bread is toasted and golden, about 2 minutes.

Using the spatula, fold in edges of omelet to align with sides of the bread. Cut omelet along center with the spatula to form 2 sandwiches. Butter 2 remaining bread slices with remaining butter; place butter side up on each sandwich. Turn sandwiches; cook until golden, about 2 minutes more. Serve and enjoy immediately!

So, what’s the catch? They’re not really biscuits. Or, at least they’re not like the classic, flaky, southern-style biscuits that most of us imagine when we think of biscuits. These are much more scone-like, which isn’t an issue, unless you want an actual biscuit.

We don’t like to waste too much time around here arguing semantics. I’m sort of burying the lead, which is that these are easy to make, impressive to look at, and very delicious to eat. Here are some notes from the chef:

But, whether you make these for a special occasion, or simply an easy weekday bake, I really do hope you give them a try soon. Enjoy!

Cut ribs of rhubarb in half lengthwise and slice into 1/4-inch pieces; place into a bowl. Add cubed strawberries and 2 tablespoons sugar. Toss to combine, cover, and let fruit macerate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.

Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a mixing bowl; whisk to combine.

Drain fruit in a strainer set over a bowl. Reserve the syrupy juices that pass through.

Grate frozen butter into the flour mixture, while stirring with a fork several times to coat butter pieces with flour. Add 1/4 cup sugar, and drained fruit, mixing with a fork until fruit is coated with flour.

Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved fruit juices, and pour in buttermilk. Mix with a fork just until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the dough. If the mixture is too dry to come together, add a little more buttermilk. If it seems too wet, and sticky, add a little more flour.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silpat mat.

Scoop or spoon equal portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Whisk together egg and water in a small bowl. Brush biscuits with egg wash, and sprinkle with sugar.

Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.

Mix powdered sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice together in a small bowl for the lemon icing. Fill icing into a piping bag or a plastic bag with the tip cut off and drizzle icing over cooled biscuits.

Wrap the banana zucchini bread tightly in foil or storage wrap and store at room temperature for up to three days or in the refrigerator for up to one week.

Yes! If you want to keep your banana zucchini bread for longer than one week, you'll need to freeze it. It's best to freeze it in individual slices so you can thaw and enjoy as-needed. Wrap the slices in a layer of storage wrap, then in a layer of foil. Place the wrapped slices in a storage bag and freeze for up to three months.

""Excellent recipe,"" raves one Allrecipes community member. ""I ran out of vanilla extract, so I used cognac instead.""

""A great bread that was moist, with both zucchini and banana flavor,"" according to jenk. ""I halved the cranberries and nuts and only put in one of the two loaves to satisfy my picky eaters. Both were great! Will make it again.""

""For some reason this bread seems healthier than plain banana bread,"" says lobij. ""The zucchini adds moisture to the batter, which results in a nice textured loaf. Added bonus: The kids don't realize there is a veggie in their banana bread.""

Basted Eggs,https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8465544/basted-eggs/,1,10,Breakfast,5.0,"1 ½ tablespoons salted butter
2 large eggs
1 tablespoon water
⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste","Have you ever made a basted egg? If you haven't, it's time to remedy that ASAP! Basted eggs are similar to poached eggs, but they're much easier to cook. You'll come back to this simple basted egg recipe time and time again.

A basted egg is somewhere between a sunny side up fried egg and a poached egg. Basted eggs are fried on the bottom and steamed on top. They look similar to sunny side up eggs, but the yolk is slightly more set.

These are the ingredients you'll need to make this basted egg recipe:

· Butter: These traditional basted eggs are cooked in butter on the stove.· Eggs: This recipe makes two basted eggs. You can easily adjust the measurements to make more or less.· Water: A tablespoon of water helps steam the top of the egg.· Seasonings: When the eggs are done, season them with flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.

You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make a basted egg at home:

Crack the egg into a skillet with melted butter. When the whites are mostly set, add water and cover. Cook until some of white has set over the yolk.

Serve basted eggs however you'd serve fried or poached eggs. They're commonly found on top of or alongside toast — check out our collection of 10 Savory Toast Recipes That Prove Everything Is Better On Bread for delicious inspiration.

Good breakfast sausages for this recipe are Jimmy Dean® or Isernio's®. You can use 1/4 cup chopped green onion instead of white onion.

There are many variations you can take on this recipe. Use leftover taco meat and pepper jack cheese. Maybe add some cream to the mixture for a creamier cookie. Bacon with Gruyere and fresh parsley would be great too. Have fun with this!

If you want to make a pancake that tastes like apple fritter doughnuts, you might be tempted to simply whip up a batch of apple fritter doughnut dough, transfer it into a hot pan, brown it on both sides, and boom! Apple fritter pancakes! Sorry, that's not going to work. I tried that, and all you really get is flat, poorly made apple fritter doughnuts.

What you really need to do is make a perfectly light, and airy pancake that tastes like an apple fritter doughnut, which is what I eventually did. And, not only were these lighter, and less dense than apple fritter doughnuts, they were lighter and less dense than regular pancakes. I'm not exactly sure how that happened, but I have a few theories.

A large portion of the batter is made up of grated, raw apple, which I was afraid would make things heavy and wet, but that didn't happen, and may have had the opposite affect by reducing the amount of flour used. I think the acidity of the apple also reacted with the baking soda, to add some lift to the pancakes, resulting in a surprisingly light, tender texture. Anyway, I'm not going to overthink it, and whatever happened was very good, which is why I really do hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!

Gather the ingredients.

Combine egg, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, kosher salt, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Whisk until well combined and lightly foamy. Add shredded apple and lemon juice and fold in with a spatula until well combined. Add flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Mix until flour disappears and batter is thick yet spoonable.

Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add tablespoonfuls of apple batter to the hot butter and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook until apple pancakes spring back to the touch and are browned on the other side, an additional 3 minutes.

Serve and enjoy!

Have you ever been eating a sweet bun or roll and thought to yourself, this is great, but I wish it had a thin, crispy sugar cookie covering the top? Well then, you're going to love conchas. This Mexican sweet bread gets its name from the seashell design traditionally used to decorate the top, but as I attempted to show in this video, we can do all sorts of variations, including pumpkins…or basketballs….go Dubs!

I made this a little more challenging for myself by adding actual pumpkin puree to the classic recipe, since we could've just gone for a pumpkin-spiced concha dough, but I'm happy to report the addition worked out quite nicely, and these were still very light and tender. That's kind of a big deal, since what makes conchas such a unique treat is the contrast between the light, airy, barely sweet bun, and the crisp, crunchy, much sweeter topping. Hot coffee sold separately.

If little pumpkins (or basketballs) aren't your thing, I invite you to do an image search for conchas, and you will see hundreds of different ways to design the tops. Many can be done by hand with a knife, but there are also stamps that are pressed into the top to make the decorative cuts. But, no matter what yours end up looking like, I really do hope you give conchas a try soon. Enjoy!

Combine flour, pumpkin puree, warm milk, egg yolk, melted butter, sugar, active dry yeast, salt, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment. Mix until a smooth, slightly elastic ball forms or knead by hand for about 5 minutes.

Place the dough in a lightly greased mixing bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours.

While dough is rising, combine powdered sugar, flour, butter, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, salt, and vanilla extract in a bowl for the topping. Mix with your hands or a spatula until a moldable dough forms. Mix in orange food coloring if you like.

Divide topping dough into 6 equal portions and shape them into balls; set onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Cover each ball with a sheet of plastic and press down with something flat and heavy (like the bottom of a glass or measuring cup) into a flat circle. Take the tip of a knife and score a pumpkin design into the topping. Place in the refrigerator to allow butter to firm up.

After the dough rises, transfer it onto a work surface and press down to remove the air. Cut into 6 equal portions and roll each portion into a smooth ball. Transfer balls onto a Silpat-lined baking sheet and press down to flatten lightly. Place the topping on top of the dough balls. Allow to proof until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Bake in the center of a preheated oven until puffed up and golden, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.

1 tablespoon unsalted butter
6  cooked breakfast sausage links
½ cup all-purpose flour
2 large eggs
1 ½ teaspoons maple syrup
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
½ cup whole milk","Tadpole in the Hole – Yes, Just Another Pastafazool-Inspired Baked Pancake

I've wanted to do another Dutch Baby video for a while now, since they always do very well traffic wise, and people seem to love them, but I wanted it to be a savory version of some kind, and I couldn't decided exactly what that should be. I eventually figured it out, thanks to, believe it or not, a pot of pastafazool.

We had some leftover breakfast sausage, which I decided to toss into a simmering pot of vegetables, beans, and macaroni, and I loved how the sweet, warm spices of the sausage worked with the subtle bitterness of the kale. At first, I was going to try to work all that into a frittata, but then I remembered my savory Dutch baby quest, and the rest is history.

As far as the recipe name goes, the first test batch came out looking like a fun-sized version of Toad in the Hole, and so it basically wrote itself. This can be done with any type of braising greens, as well as different kinds of sausage, but I thought the ""brown-and-serve"" style breakfast links were fast, easy, and paired perfectly. No matter how you tweak yours, I really hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!

Place a pot of lightly salted water over high heat and bring to a brisk boil. Add kale and boil until leaves just start to get tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Place kale into a bowl of cold water, then drain. Gently squeeze out as much excess water as possible and roughly chop kale; set kale aside. You will need about 1/2 cup of chopped kale.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook sausage links until browned, 2 minutes per side. Remove from skillet.

Use butter and fat from cooking to grease two 9-ounce baking dishes.

Whisk together flour, eggs, maple syrup, salt, pepper, and cayenne in a bowl. Whisk until flour disappears. Pour in milk and whisk to combine. Stir in about 1/2 cup chopped kale and mix in with a fork.

Ladle mixture into prepared baking dishes - the depth of the batter needs to be about 1/2 inch deep. Place sausage links on top of the mixture.

Place dishes in the center of a cold oven. Turn heat to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) and leave in for about 25 minutes. Remove and serve.

You can use any chopped braising green instead of kale, like chard, spinach, etc.

The two baking dishes I used were 9-ounces each, but this can be made in any shaped baking dish or pan, as long as the batter is about 1/2 inch deep once poured in.

Add a poached egg to the top if desired.

You likely already have all the ingredients you'll need for this waffle recipe. If not, here's what to add to your grocery list:

· Eggs: This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.· Flour: All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.· Milk: Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.· Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.· Sugar: A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.· Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.· Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!· Vanilla: A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor.· Cooking spray: You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles.

You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make the best waffles of your life:

1. Make the batter: Whisk the eggs, then add the flour, milk, and oil. Whisk in the sugar. Stir in the remaining ingredients.2. Make the waffles: Pour the batter onto the hot, prepared waffle iron. Cook until golden brown and repeat with the remaining batter.

For the most traditional experience, top each waffle with butter and maple syrup. But that's not the only way to enjoy this top-rated recipe! Try one of these delicious ways to take your waffles up a notch:

· Blueberry sauce· Nuts (such as pecans or walnuts)· Vanilla glaze· Nutella· Homemade whipped cream· Fresh berries (such as blueberries or strawberries)

Pair these waffles with classic breakfast fare (think scrambled eggs, bacon, or yogurt). If you're serving them for lunch or dinner, consider serving them with fried chicken! Chicken and waffles is never a bad idea, after all.

Yes! We recommend making the batter ahead of time and cooking the waffles just before serving. For make-ahead waffle batter, simply prepare the batter according to the recipe and cover. Refrigerate for up to one week and whisk before using.

Allow the leftover waffles to cool, then transfer them to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to three days. For best results, reheat in a toaster or toaster oven.

Yes, you can freeze waffles for up to three months. Arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet and flash freeze for a few hours or up to overnight. When the waffles are frozen solid, transfer them to an airtight container or freezer-safe bag. There's no need to thaw — reheat them the way you would store-bought frozen waffles (in the toaster or microwave).

""Great basic waffle recipe,"" says Charlotte Wardrop. ""I add nutmeg and cinnamon and a touch more vanilla to really make the recipe kick. Also if you have matcha powder on hand you can add some to make a great matcha waffle!""

""Totally perfect as written,"" according to Angie In Progress. ""No changes necessary. Quick, easy, crispy on the outside and just sweet enough to be totally delicious!""

""Very easy and good recipe for homemade waffles,"" raves AngPayne. ""My family loves waffles anytime of the day and being able to keep the batter in the fridge is perfect for my busy schedule!""

1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or more as needed","If you're looking for the best French toast recipe on the internet, you've come to the right place. This tender, fluffy, and indulgent recipe comes together quickly and easily with just five ingredients you already have on hand.

How do you know it's good? Because this deliciously easy recipe has earned nearly 2,000 rave reviews from the Allrecipes community. Happy home cooks call it a ""definite keeper"" and ""a Sunday morning favorite"" (among many other ringing endorsements).

Here's everything you need to know about making the best French toast of your life, including the best bread to use and what ingredients you need. Plus, get our best storage secrets and freezer hacks.

It's easier than you think to make restaurant-quality French toast in the comfort of your own kitchen – you just need a skillet, a few staple ingredients, and a good recipe. That's where we come in!

The best breads for French toast are brioche, sourdough, French bread, or challah. These varieties are dense and sturdy enough to handle total saturation in the wet, milky, egg custard without falling apart. However, in a pinch, any thick-sliced white bread will do.

French toast is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh ones (and this method prevents waste – it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine.

Every home cook has their own twist on basic French toast, but most variations contain the following ingredients:

Nope! French toast (pain perdu in French) isn't actually from France. Legend has it that a man named Joseph French from the U.S. created the sweet breakfast dish in 1724 and named it after himself. However, that's probably not true: People were frying milk- and egg-soaked bread in Ancient Rome, according to early recipes.

It's more likely that modern French toast was invented by 15th-century cooks who were on a mission to use up stale bread.

Let your leftover French toast cool completely, then place it in an airtight container (such as a zip-top bag or a reusable storage container). Store it in the fridge for about one to three days.

Yes, you can freeze a big-batch of French toast for up to three months. Arrange the slices in a single layer on a baking sheet, freeze for at least four hours or up to overnight, then store frozen French toast in a freezer-safe container for two to three months. When you're ready to eat it, just throw it on a baking sheet and bake at 375°F until hot and cooked through, about 8-12 minutes.

""I used fresh French bread with this recipe,"" says ATOMICLUSH. ""It came out quite good. I added a little bit of sugar to the recipe to give it a little sweetness and I topped it off with powdered sugar!""

""Fast and easy, and made with ingredients you already likely have in the house,"" raves JENNYDEVALL.

""This recipe is really good and easy, and you can even make it with cheap sandwich bread if that's all you have on hand,"" according to Bryan R. ""The key to this recipe is not to soak the bread too much. Put your slice in the mixing bowl, flip it right over, and then put it on the griddle. I experimented with soaking the bread more, and it ends up being soggy and undercooked.""

Banana Pancakes,https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/20334/banana-pancakes-i/,6,15,Breakfast,4.5,"1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
¼ teaspoon salt
1  egg, beaten
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2  ripe bananas, mashed","Wake up on the right side of the bed with a stack of sweet, cozy, and simple banana pancakes. This top-rated banana pancake recipe is easy to make and it comes together in just 15 minutes, so you don't have to wake up early to enjoy a satisfying breakfast. Learn how to make, store, and serve the best banana pancakes ever.

If you have ready-to-use bananas and a few kitchen staples, you already have everything you need to make perfect banana pancakes.

FlourAll-purpose flour contains gluten, a protein that gives the pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.

SugarGranulated sugar adds sweetness, helps hold in moisture, and may create a tender texture.

Baking PowderBaking powder is a leavener. It creates air bubbles in the batter, which ensures light and fluffy pancakes.

SaltSalt adds subtle depth to all sorts of sweet dishes, including pancakes. You won't be able to detect it in the finished product, but you'll miss it if you leave it out.

An EggEggs work with the other ingredients to bind and provide structure. The fatty yolks also add rich flavor and extra moisture.

MilkNot only does milk add flavor, it is the liquid base that's essential for dissolving the dry ingredients and creating a cohesive batter.

Vegetable OilVegetable oil is harder to burn than butter, so it's a great fat to use in banana pancakes. It keeps the pancakes moist and prevents them from sticking to the pan.

BananasLast but certainly not least, you'll need two mashed bananas for these pancakes. The bananas will help hold the other ingredients together and add mellow, fruity flavor.

It really couldn't be easier to make this basic banana pancake recipe. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy.

Pour the batter in ¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook for another few minutes (or until each side is golden brown).

Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with your favorite pancake toppings.

A plate full of plain banana pancakes is like a blank canvas. When it comes to toppings, you can keep it simple or get as creative as you want. If you're in need of a little inspiration, here are some of our favorite ideas:

Maple Syrup or Pancake SyrupYou can't go wrong with the classics. As delicious as these banana pancakes are, a drizzle of maple or pancake syrup will send them over the top.

Honey and Peanut ButterFor a more wholesome option, try topping your pancakes with honey. Dollop some peanut butter on there for a delicious, sandwich-inspired breakfast.

Fruit and Whipped CreamAdd a little color to your breakfast plate with fresh berries, citrus wedges, or even some banana slices to really drive the theme home. Homemade or store-bought whipped cream is an extra special touch that pairs perfectly with fruit.

Nutella Who says you can't eat dessert for breakfast? Top your banana pancakes with Nutella (or your favorite chocolate-hazelnut spread) for an indulgent morning treat.

Jam or JellyA spoonful of jam or jelly is a fruity upgrade that everyone will love. Sprinkle it with powdered sugar for extra flavor.

Don't throw away your extra pancakes! You can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for about two to three days. When you're ready to eat them, just reheat in the microwave until the pancakes are warmed through.

Yes, you can freeze banana pancakes — and it's a great idea if you like to meal prep breakfasts. It couldn't be easier: Allow the pancakes to cool to room temperature, stack them in an airtight container with wax paper between each pancake (to prevent sticking), and freeze for about three months.

There's no need to thaw frozen pancakes. Simply reheat them in the toaster, microwave, or oven.

""Just a tip for fuss free banana mashing ... stick them in a zip-lock bag, zip and squeeze,"" suggests a_houghtaling. ""When you're done, cut a corner off and you have a pour spout!""

""These pancakes were the best pancakes I have ever eaten,"" raves J Marcy. ""My boyfriend and I cannot seem to get enough of them.""

""Delicious,"" says GIN18734. ""I added a little bit of cinnamon to the banana mixture to give it more flavor.""

Gather all ingredients.

Combine flour, white sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Mix together egg, milk, vegetable oil, and bananas in a second bowl.

Stir flour mixture into banana mixture; batter will be slightly lumpy.

Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.

Cook until pancakes are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Serve hot.

1 ½ tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 ½ tablespoons poppy seeds
1 tablespoon dried minced onion
24  mini sandwich rolls
1 pound thinly sliced cooked deli ham
1 pound thinly sliced Swiss cheese","There's never a bad time to eat irresistibly decadent ham and cheese sliders. These party-friendly sandwiches boast buttery rolls that surround savory deli meat, melted Swiss cheese, and sharp, spicy Dijon mustard.

Whether you're feeding a large crowd or a family of four, these perfectly delicious oven-baked sliders are a surefire way to make it a celebratory occasion. Our community of home cooks gives this easy recipe high marks for flavor and fun factor.

Sliders are the little sandwiches that shine as a starter or main course. Mini sandwich rolls (Hawaiian sweet rolls are a popular choice) are layered with ham and cheese before being coated with a mixture of butter, Dijon mustard, and dried minced onion.

The result is gooey, tangy, and wholly satisfying sliders that will appeal to every kind of eater. You can opt in or out of the poppy seeds, but they do add a great crunch to the soft, melty texture.

These super savory baked sandwiches make an excellent appetizer or main dish. Serve them along with other small bites like chips and dip, nuts, and fresh fruit for an impressive starter course. Make sliders the centerpiece of your meal by pairing them with sides like grilled asparagus, pasta salad, or roasted potatoes.

Properly stored sliders can last up to two days in the refrigerator. When it's time to reheat, simply cover the ham and cheese sandwiches and bake at 350 degrees F until warmed thoroughly.

Ham and cheese sliders can be made ahead of time and frozen for up to 6 months. Allow slides to thaw overnight before baking.

""Everyone loved them!"" raves Dining Diva. ""I used cherrywood ham, cheddar cheese, and everything bagel topping instead of just poppy seeds. Followed the advice of covering with foil half of the cooking time.""

""Very tasty and easy to make,"" says Allstar SunnyDaysNora. ""I left out the poppy seeds as I realized too late that I was out. I used Swiss cheese as written on half of the sandwiches and American cheese on the other for my daughter. Definitely a keeper!""

""Wish I could give this 10 stars,"" shares home cook Macy. ""These are off the chart good. Wonderful eaten hot or cold. Couldn't stop eating these things.""

A Sloppy Joe is a sandwich consisting of ground beef and onions in a tomato-based sauce served on a hamburger bun.

The sandwich likely originated in Sioux City, Iowa in the 1930s. According to legend, the ""loose meat sandwich"" was the creation of a cook named Joe.

""There's no need to pull out any of that canned stuff,"" according to Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom), who says you've already got everything you need to make a perfect Sloppy Joe sitting in your pantry. Here are a few of her favorite Sloppy Joe tips and tricks:

· Nicole doesn't like to drain the meat after she cooks it (she likes to use the rendered fat to saute the onions and bell peppers), so she prefers using a lean meat.· ""When it comes to the bun,"" Nicole says, ""the cheaper the better."" For the classic Sloppy Joe experience, you want it to absorb all the excess liquid.· Make sure to overfill the bun so that some meat spills out. Why? So you can scoop it up with potato chips, of course!

Recipe creator Tamara suggests serving these Sloppy Joe sandwiches with homemade sweet potato fries. They also pair well with all kinds of diner-style side dishes! For instance:

· Homemade Crispy Seasoned French Fries· Homemade Mac and Cheese· Refrigerator Dill Pickles· Restaurant-Style House Salad· Boston Baked Beans

8 cups broccoli florets
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
  ground black pepper to taste","Make restaurant-worthy cream of broccoli soup in the comfort of your own kitchen with this top-rated recipe. It's thick, flavorful, creamy, and easy to throw together on whim with simple ingredients.

Here's what you'll need to make the best cream of broccoli soup ever:

ButterYou'll use butter twice in this recipe. Once to sauté the onions and celery (butter adds rich flavor to sautéed vegetables) and again at the end to make a roux.

Onions and CeleryLike so many great soups, this recipe starts with onions and celery. These veggies add complexity and depth of flavor.

BrothChicken broth is the liquid base for this cream of broccoli soup. For a vegetarian option, substitute vegetable broth.

BroccoliYou can't have cream of broccoli soup without broccoli! Choose dark green broccoli with firm stems.

Flour, Milk, and ButterAll-purpose flour, milk, and the rest of the butter are cooked together to create a roux. When added to the soup, it creates a thick and velvety texture that's impossible to resist.

PepperGround black pepper is the perfect finishing touch. Add other spices and seasonings to taste.

You can make this cream of broccoli soup recipe in about a half an hour, so it's the perfect choice for busy weeknights. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

Sauté the onions and celery in butter until they're tender. Add the broccoli florets and the chicken broth, cover the pot, and simmer for about 10 minutes.

You can use a countertop blender or an immersion blender to purée the soup. Give it a few quick pulses, then blend continuously until the soup is totally smooth.

Melt a few tablespoons of butter in a separate saucepan. Stir in the flour, then the milk. Cook the milk mixture until it's thick and bubbly, then add it to the soup. Finish it off with a dash of pepper (and the other seasonings of your choosing).

You'll need to refrigerate this soup within two hours of cooking. Let it cool to room temperature, then transfer it to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for three to four days.

Yes! You can absolutely freeze cream of broccoli soup — and you should if you plan to keep it for more than a few days.

Ladle the soup in serving-sized portions into zip-top freezer bags. Label the bags with the date, lay them flat in the freezer, and freeze for up to two to three months.

""Delicious and buttery,"" raves LoriT. ""I used skim milk and it was great. Like some of the other reviews, I scooped out about a ladle of the cooked broccoli and did not puree it. Adding it back to the pureed mixture gave the soup a more hearty texture.""

""This is the ultimate comfort food,"" according to misscarolb. ""It's so simple to throw together and takes almost no time at all. I feel so great eating things that aren't full of processed ingredients, and I definitely can't wait to harvest my own vegetables this summer and make this again. This one is going straight in the recipe book.""

""I make this soup a couple times a month, with the intention of freezing it for later use,"" says Julia Courtney. ""The problem is ... we always eat it all! I drizzle mine with olive oil and sprinkle with fresh grated Parmesan cheese! SO good!""

Editorial contributions by Corey Williams

Gather all ingredients.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium stock pot over medium heat. Saute onion and celery until tender.

Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use an immersion blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot.

Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium to medium-low heat; stir in flour and add milk. Stir until thick and bubbly, and add to soup. Season with pepper and serve.

The kind of potatoes you use will affect the texture of your potato salad. The recipe does not specify what kind of potatoes to use, but here are some guidelines to help you choose the best potatoes for potato salad so you get the results you're looking for.

This recipe for Old-Fashioned Potato Salad instructs you to boil unpeeled potatoes in salted water until they're tender but still firm. You'll drain them and let them cool a bit, then peel and chop into bite-sized pieces. (Boiling helps the potato skins slip off easily.) Depending on how large your potatoes are, boiling could take between 10 to 15 minutes or more. Start testing for doneness at about 10 minutes by piecing a potato with a sharp paring knife. If it slides in easily all the way to the center of the potato, the potato is cooked and ready to drain.

Flavor-boosting tip: Potatoes have a very mild flavor on their own; that's why you add salt to the boiling water. To add even more flavor to the boiled potatoes, lay them out on a rimmed baking sheet after peeling and chopping, and while they're still warm. Sprinkle them with a little vinegar, salt, and pepper. Let the potatoes cool until they're not steaming anymore, then proceed with the rest of the recipe.

Potato salad should be covered and stored in the refrigerator. Do not let potato salad sit at room temperature for more than two hours, or even less on a warm day. If you're serving potato salad at a picnic or BBQ, place the serving bowl in a bed of ice to keep it very cool.

Properly wrapped and chilled, potato salad will last in the refrigerator for three or four days.

Yes, you can freeze potato salad. For best results, cool it completely then spoon it into an airtight freezer bag and lay it flat. Squeeze out as much air as you can without crushing the potato salad. If you have a lot of potato salad to freeze, use two or more bags. Thinner layers are best both for freezing and thawing. Properly frozen potato salad will last in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight. You might have to add a little more dressing before serving potato salad that has been frozen and thawed.

""We love this recipe, says Allrecipes home cook cakesnthings. ""I have made it several times. The only thing that I do differently is use sweet pickles chopped up instead of using sweet relish. I really like the flavor that the celery salt gives this dish, I would not leave this spice out.""

Leslie Landreth says, ""This was my first attempt at homemade potato salad and it turned out remarkably well. I made it for 4th of July and it went over well with the family. The only thing that I did different was I doubled the mayo and added 1 tablespoon of milk to make it creamy. It was very good and full of flavor!""

""This recipe is just what it says it is, old fashioned potato salad. My guests and I LOVED it. I made it the night before and let it meld overnight. This made it much easier to concentrate on the Fourth of July slow cooked baby back ribs. If you are looking for grandma's potato salad, look no further,"" says George Van Aken.

You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:

This classic grilled cheese sandwich recipe calls for just white bread, sliced cheese, and butter. It's easy to switch up the bread and cheese to suit your taste preferences and, if you like, you can substitute mayonnaise for butter.

This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a wonderfully crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp Cheddar, mild Cheddar, or a blend of both. Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American cheese – it tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull.

Other delicious options are Gruyere, Brie, Fontina, Gouda, Pepper Jack, and havarti.

Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:

1. Butter the bread on one side and place the bread butter-side down on a hot skillet.2. Top with cheese, then place another slice of bread on top (butter-side up).3. Cook until the bottom slice is lightly browned, then flip.4. Continue cooking until the cheese is melted.

""My first grilled cheese and it was delicious,"" raves Chinwe Ogolo. ""I enjoyed the simplicity. Thank you for the recipe.""

""I learned in a restaurant that if you use a larger pan and leave the sandwich open in the pan on low heat to fry...the cheese will be melted perfectly and the outsides will be perfectly golden,"" according to Chandra Davidson.

""To make a GREAT sandwich awesome, just sprinkle some Parmesan cheese on the buttered bread before putting it into the skillet,"" says Sheri Cooper. ""WOW, what an upgrade in flavor.""

Editorial contributions by Corey Williams

Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.

Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.

"Marinated Cucumber, Onion, and Tomato Salad",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/237984/marinated-cucumber-onion-and-tomato-salad/,6,120,Lunch,4.7,"1 cup water
½ cup distilled white vinegar
¼ cup vegetable oil
¼ cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
3  cucumbers, peeled and sliced 1/4-inch thick
3  tomatoes, cut into wedges
1  onion, sliced and separated into rings","There's a lot to love about this top-rated cucumber tomato salad recipe. It's inexpensive to make using everyday ingredients, it's a crisp and refreshing side dish that goes with just about anything, and it has make-ahead convenience built right in. Let's dive into this dish and see why Allrecipes home cooks award it a solid 5-stars.

This recipe for Marinated Cucumber, Onion, and Tomato Salad has most of the ingredients right there in the title. Cool, crisp cucumbers and juicy ripe tomatoes are teamed up with onions in a satisfying mix of flavor and texture. But what pulls this dish together is the tart and tangy salad dressing made of water, vinegar, oil, sugar, salt, and pepper.

It takes only 15 minutes to prep the salad itself: Whisk the ingredients for the dressing, peel and slice the cucumbers, cut the tomatoes into wedges, slice the onion into rings, and place everything together in a bowl. After that, it goes into the refrigerator to marinate for at least two hours so the dressing can work its magic to enhance and balance all the flavors. That marination step means you can make this salad well ahead of time and stash it in the fridge until you're ready to dish it up.

CucumbersChoose firm cucumbers with smooth, firm skins and no soft spots. Cucumbers lose water quickly after they're picked and will start to show shrinking and wrinkling if they've been in storage for too long.

TomatoesThis recipe doesn't specify what kind of tomatoes to use, but you'll want to choose the ripest, tastiest tomatoes you can find. Heirloom tomatoes have the best flavor, but unless you grow them yourself, they can be pricier than the everyday tomatoes from your supermarket. You can use cherry tomatoes or Roma tomatoes, too. Whichever tomato variety you choose, get the best you can afford because the flavor of the tomatoes play a starring role. If you do use smaller tomatoes, be sure to slice them so the marinade can soak in and do its work.

Read more: How to Pick the Best Tomatoes

OnionsYou can use any onion you like for this recipe: yellow, white, or red. Each brings a different flavor profile to the mix. Yellow onions are inexpensive, easy to find, and have a predictable onion flavor. White onions are a bit sweeter and milder than yellow onions. Red onions are a little spicier than yellow onions, and carry their bright color through to the salad. Sweet onions are pricier, and as the name suggests, their flavor is milder and naturally sweeter.

Read more: What's the Difference Between White, Yellow, and Red Onions?

VinegarThe recipe lists distilled white vinegar, but here again you can substitute other vinegars to suit your taste. Some Allrecipes home cooks who made this recipe used white wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar, Champagne vinegar, rice wine vinegar, and white balsamic vinegar.

OilVegetable oil is called out in this recipe, and it's a good choice because of its neutral flavor. But you can also use good quality olive oil if you prefer, as some reviewers did.

Properly covered and chilled, cucumber tomato salad will last 3-5 days in the refrigerator. The cucumbers might lose a little crispness after a couple of days depending on their freshness when you used them and how thickly you sliced them. The onions will continue to mellow and take up the sweet and tart flavors of the dressing. The tomatoes should still be juicy and flavorful, although their structure may break down a bit as they soak.

The real question is, what doesn't go with cucumber tomato salad? This crisp, light, sweet, tart, crunchy, juicy salad is a perfect side dish for everything from grilled foods and fried foods to saucy BBQ dishes and everyday picnic sandwiches. Cucumber tomato salad provides a snappy contrast to creamy potato, macaroni, or pasta salads, and can hold its own in any potluck buffet.

""Super easy recipe. Love it,"" says Allrecipes home cook Bethany Idontwanttouseit. ""Followed advice of some others and made with apple cider vinegar. Delicious. Also used a sweet onion since it didn't specify. I found that the longer it marinated, the better it was.""

Reviewer Jimdchimp9 says, ""Big hit this summer! Made it a couple times. Second time I used a little less water but it is great. I made it again today for a church get together and was asked by a few people for this recipe.""

""Just made this and WOW! Love it. Wo delicious. I used Vidalia onion and cherry tomatoes. I also used the apple cider vinegar, which I think gives it this fantastic taste,"" says Loulou.

A corn dog is a sausage (usually a hot dog) that has been skewered, coated in a cornmeal batter, and deep-fried. A staple of American cuisine, the street food was likely invented by German immigrants in Texas in the 1920s.

These are the ingredients you'll need to make this homemade corn dog recipe:

· Cornmeal and flour: This corn dog batter starts with yellow cornmeal and all-purpose flour.· Sugar: A pinch of sugar lends a hint of sweetness.· Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.· Salt and pepper: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.· Milk: A cup of milk adds moisture, ensuring a tender coating.· Egg: An egg gives the batter even more moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together.· Oil: Fry the corn dogs in a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable oil.· Beef frankfurters: This recipe calls for beef frankfurters, but you can use pork franks (or hot dogs) if you'd prefer.

1 cup heavy whipping cream
1  salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves for garnish, or to taste","You're bound to love the uniquely earthy and creamy flavor of Chef John's mushroom soup recipe. Garlic, cream, and fresh thyme join meaty caramelized mushrooms and diced onions for a rich, fragrant bowlful of homemade goodness.

This comforting soup recipe makes an enticing appetizer course or stand-alone dish — experience the velvety swirls of flavor for yourself (and never buy the store-bought stuff again).

Luscious, herb-infused mushroom soup is just a few steps away. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe:

A hearty bowl of mushroom soup is a meal in itself, but this dish pairs well with many other foods. Crispy baked chicken or a peppery skirt steak would both make good partners for this top-rated recipe.

Or, serve cream of mushroom soup with crisp, tangy salad to cut through the richness. Any way you serve it, Chef John's savory offering will keep you coming back for more.

Mushroom soup can be safely stored in the refrigerator for up to one week. Wait for the soup to fully cool before. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in a microwave.

Looking to save some soup for later? You can freeze the leftovers for up to two months if stored properly. Place single servings of room temperature soup in freezer bags, squeeze out any air, seal, and lay flat for best results.

""The flavor is absolutely delicious,"" says reviewer gellerd. ""If you love mushrooms and want to feel like a professional chef, make this soup. Outstanding recipe, Chef John!""

""This recipe takes time but is worth the effort,"" shares home cook Lindsey. ""I used a mixture of crimini and shiitake mushrooms. I can't eat cream so I added lactose-free milk with a bit of corn starch.""

Gather all ingredients.

Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Sauté mushrooms and 1 pinch salt in the melted butter until mushrooms release their juices, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring often, until juices evaporate and mushrooms are caramelized, 15 to 25 minutes. Set aside a few attractive mushroom slices for garnish later, if desired.

Add onion to the mushrooms; cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.

Stir flour into the mushroom mixture and cook, stirring often, to remove the raw flour taste, about 2 minutes.

Add thyme bundle and garlic cloves, then pour in 4 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Remove and discard thyme bundle.

Purée soup with a blender in batches until smooth and thick.

Stir in cream. If too thick, add a little chicken broth or water. Season with salt and black pepper.

Ladle into bowls, and garnish with reserved mushroom slices and thyme leaves.

Prep time assumes you are using pre-sliced mushrooms. If not, your prep time will be longer.

You can also use an immersion stick blender to purée the soup.

Boil rotini in lightly salted water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, rinse in cold water, then drain again. Transfer the cooked pasta to a large bowl. Toss with pepperoni, provolone cheese, red onion, cucumber, bell peppers, olives, parsley, and Parmesan cheese.

Mix olive oil, vinegar, garlic, basil, oregano, ground mustard, salt, and pepper in a jar with a lid. Tightly seal the jar, then shake until combined.

Pour the dressing into the bowl with the pasta salad. Toss until well-combined. You can serve immediately, but we recommend allowing the pasta salad to chill in the fridge for about eight hours before serving. This will give the flavors time to meld.

Since this pasta salad dressing is oil-based, it'll keep a little longer than its dairy-based counterparts. Store pasta salad with dressing in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days. It's best served cold, so you won't need to reheat it — just take it straight out of the fridge and enjoy!

We don't always recommend freezing cooked pasta because too-soft pasta will not hold up well in the freezer. However, if you make sure your pasta is al dente, it should be fine.

To freeze pasta salad with dressing, simply transfer it to a freezer-safe container (or multiple zip-top bags wrapped in storage wrap and foil, if you don't plan to thaw the whole batch at once). Label with the date and freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight.

""This is so delicious,"" raves massmom5. ""Absolutely the best pasta salad I've ever eaten! I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used half the amount of dried. I omitted the black olives because I'm the only one who likes them. I followed another reviewer's advice and quartered sliced pepperoni and used slices of provolone that I cut into strips. I took it to a 4th of July picnic today and I got so many compliments.""

""Everyone liked this recipe,"" says gtyyup. ""Changed a few veggie ingredients to what I had on hand, but this recipe is great to be able to make changes to particular tastes.""

""This is a KEEPER,"" according to karlawithak. ""It's great because you can use whatever veggies you have in the fridge. I used pepperoncini, roasted red peppers, sliced mini-peppers, sliced red onion. No olives or provolone, mainly because I didn't have them. Also didn't have pepperoni, but will include it next time. The dressing is terrific, I agree. I only used ½ the dressing to lighten it up. Only problem is not eating all the leftovers tomorrow when no one is looking…""

“I added some dried parsley flakes to the mixture and some grated Parmesan cheese to the bread crumb coating,” says CookinLovin. “Served on French-style buns with lettuce, mayo, and honey mustard and a side of onion rings. YUM!”

“Really simple and quick — dinner was ready way earlier than I'd planned,” says Rusty Brown. “Came out great! The cooking instructions of 5-6 minutes per side were just right.”

“They were the best burgers we have had in years,” raves beulah. “The only change I made to the recipe was to not use breadcrumbs but instead to use ground up crackers. The grated onion makes all the difference. I put in a little bit of fresh parsley and they were heavenly!”

“I followed this recipe exactly as written and it was delicious,” according to Denise. “I have leftover balsamic reduction which I’m going to brush on grilled chicken.”

“I have made this recipe twice now and both times it was the showstopper at the table,” says Joyce Fahey. “It's so easy to make! The key is to reduce the balsamic until it's really thick. I think it's the longer reduction process that really makes the flavor shine here.”

“A Caprese Salad is the best taste of summer,” raves Linda Morency Giuffre. “And this balsamic reduction is the best way to enjoy it.”

Japanese Tamago Egg,https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/221923/japanese-tamago-egg/,6,25,Lunch,4.7,"4  eggs
1/4 cup prepared dashi stock
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil, or more as needed","This top-rated tamago recipe seems intimidating, but it’s surprisingly easy to make at home!

Tamago (a.k.a. tamagoyaki) is a Japanese omelet. It’s made by rolling together thin layers of fried eggs, then slicing the log into rectangles. Since the egg is mixed with dashi, sugar, and mirin, the finished product has a complex and subtly sweet flavor. Tamago is traditionally served for breakfast or as a sushi ingredient.

These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this tamago recipe:

You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below – but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make tamago at home:

Tip from recipe creator Pokerman11: It is best to use a tamago pan, which is a 5x7-inch square nonstick frying pan, but any small pan will work — you just won't have square ends on your finished omelet.

Enjoy the homemade tamago right away or freeze it for up to two weeks. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator.

“This was a great recipe,” according to one Allrecipes community member. “I did not have the dashi, so I substituted with chicken broth and a splash of seasoned rice wine vinegar. It was great.”

“So yummy and easy,” raves NicholeB. “I used a round skillet and it worked great. Probably not as pretty, but tasted fantastic.”

Editorial contributions by Corey Williams

Beat eggs thoroughly in a bowl; whisk in dashi stock, sugar, mirin, and soy sauce until sugar has dissolved.

Lightly grease a nonstick skillet and heat over medium heat.

Pour a thin layer of egg mixture into the hot pan and swirl to coat the pan. Cook until egg layer is firm on the bottom but still slightly liquid on top, about 1 minute. Then lift up one edge using a spatula and roll up the egg layer. Push omelet roll to one side of the skillet. Oil the skillet again and pour in another thin layer of egg, lifting the first omelet roll up slightly to allow the egg to flow underneath; roll up the first omelet in the new layer of egg and push omelet to the edge of the skillet as before. Repeat the process with the remaining egg mixture, oiling the pan each time if needed.

Remove rolled omelet to a serving platter and cut into 6 equal pieces to serve.

It is best to use a tamago pan, which is a 5x7-inch square nonstick frying pan, but any small pan will work — you just won't have square ends on your finished omelet.

Mirin is sweet rice wine and dashi is traditional Japanese soup stock made from kelp or shiitake. These ingredients are now carried in most larger grocery stores or at Asian markets.

Grilled Tomahawk Steak,https://www.allrecipes.com/grilled-tomahawk-steak-recipe-7508957,6,780,Dinner,4.5,"1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon ontreal steak seasoning
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 (2 3/4 pound) tomahawk steak
1/4 cup salted butter, at room temperature
1 tablespoon shallot
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chives
2 teaspoons steak rub","To make steak rub, place brown sugar, Montreal steak seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small airtight container; shake or stir to combine. Set aside 2 teaspoons steak rub to use in compound butter.

Place steak on a half sheet pan, and rub steak on top, bottom, and sides with remaining steak rub until well coated. Place steak, uncovered, in the refrigerator to dry-brine overnight.

For compound butter, place butter, shallot, garlic, chives, and the reserved 2 teaspoons steak rub in a small bowl. Mash together with a fork until evenly combined. Spoon butter into a small airtight container, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.

Remove steak from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to take the chill off. It will cook on the sheet pan that you used for dry-brining.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). The reverse sear method is used to cook this big steak, so you will need an instant-read thermometer. If you are using a digital meat thermometer, set the internal temperature to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).

Bake steak on the sheet pan in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 110 degrees F (43 degrees C), about 45 minutes. Begin checking the temperature at 30 minutes.

During the last 15 to 20 minutes of cooking time, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.

When steak reaches an internal temperature of  110 degrees F (43 degrees C) measured with an instant-read thermometer, remove it from the oven.

Grill steak directly on the grates of the preheated grill; sear on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. This is a fatty piece of meat, so be mindful of flame flare-ups. The internal temperature should now read 125 to 135 degrees F (51 to 57 degrees C) for medium rare.

Remove steak from the grill, and smear compound butter over top. Let butter melt into the steak, heating up the fresh garlic, shallots, and chives. Let steak rest for 10 minutes.

Slice steak and serve with accumulated juices and melted butter. Be sure to serve the bone–someone will want to gnaw on it!

To make this an easy meal, I like to serve the steak on a platter of baked rice, and a chopped wedge salad with Bob's Blue Cheese Dressing! You can make the baked rice the day before, then reheat it with your steak. And the wedge salad can be assembled in the morning, and kept in the fridge until you're ready to serve.

Searing the steak on each side produces that crispy crust without overcooking the steak.

Crispy empanadas, guaranteed! If you don't have a deep-fry thermometer, you can still estimate the temperature of the oil. Just place the handle of your wooden spoon (or a wooden chopstick) into the oil. If a steady stream of bubbles emerges from the wood, the oil is perfect. If the oil starts rapidly bubbling, or if only a few bubbles are present, then the oil is too hot or too cold, respectively.

""So delicious,"" raves Amy Lemelin. ""I added a teaspoon of crushed garlic and a dash of chili pepper. I typed with crushed saltines and cooked bacon. This is my new favorite recipe!""

Editorial contributions by Corey Williams

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.

Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.

While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.

Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.

Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.

Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.

Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:

The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:

Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:

The detailed layering instructions can be found in the recipe below, but this is the order you'll follow:

The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.

Wondering what goes with lasagna? We've got you covered. Check out our collection of 12 Easy Side Dishes for Lasagna for delicious serving inspiration. These are a few of the recipes you'll find:

You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short on time, but be aware that it will change the texture of the noodles. The best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's heated through and the sauce is bubbly.

If you're planning to freeze lasagna, it's best to cook it in a foil baking dish. Allow the casserole to cool, then cover the whole thing in at least one layer of storage wrap. Wrap it again in aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn. Freeze for up to three months.

Thaw the frozen lasagna in the refrigerator overnight, then follow the reheating instructions above. If you don't have time to thaw in the fridge, you can reheat it from frozen — just make sure to add a few minutes to the cook time to ensure the dish is heated through.

Gather all your ingredients.

Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.

Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.

In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.

Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.

Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.

Juicy Roasted Chicken,https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/83557/juicy-roasted-chicken/,6,120,Dinner,4.7,"1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed
  salt and black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste
½ cup butter or margarine
1 stalk celery, leaves removed","Roasted chicken never fails to impress, but it's surprisingly simple to make! This juicy roasted chicken recipe is perfect for beginner cooks and old pros alike.

Roasting a whole chicken at home is easier than it seems. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:

These are the ingredients you'll need to make the juiciest roast chicken recipe of your life:

· Chicken: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.· Seasonings: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, and onion powder.· Butter: Butter (or margarine, if you prefer) locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to adhere to.· Celery: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.

Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade roasted chicken:

1. Season the chicken inside and out.2. Add the butter to the chicken and the pan.3. Stuff the cavity with celery.4. Bake until the chicken is fully roasted.

In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, a 3-pound whole chicken should be completely cooked in a little more than an hour. You'll know it's done when the meat is no longer pink at the bone, the juices run clear, and an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh (near the bone) reads 165 degrees F.

""Roasting a whole chicken at home requires almost no effort and very few ingredients,"" says culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). Here are a few of her favorite tips for perfect roasted chicken every time:

· The most important thing to know, according to Nicole: ""Dry skin is crispy skin."" Make sure you get the skin nice and dry with a paper towel before you season the chicken.· ""Don't forget to season the inside as well as the outside,"" says Nicole, who recommends also getting under the skin with butter for extra flavor.· If you don't have a roasting pan, that's totally fine. Nicole prefers using a simple baking sheet with a rack on top.· To prevent the wings from burning during the long roasting process, Nicole tucks them under the bird before sticking the chicken in the oven.

Allow your leftover roast chicken to cool completely, then store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days. Reheat thoroughly in the oven or in the microwave.

""The chicken had a very nice flavor and was very juicy and tender,"" says OT. ""The only thing I changed is using two stalks of celery instead of one. I'm definitely going to make this chicken again and I may add garlic and thyme next time.""

""The family LOVES it — it's always juicy and tender,"" raves one Allrecipes community member. ""The gravy from the drippings is perfect. It's become part of the regular rotation.""

""I made some changes, but this is my favorite way to make chicken,"" says kitty28806. ""I add butter under the skin mixed with seasoning. Comes out perfectly.""

Editorial contributions by Corey Williams

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Place chicken in a roasting pan; season generously inside and out with onion powder, salt, and pepper. Place 3 tablespoons of butter in chicken cavity; arrange dollops of remaining butter on the outside of chicken. Cut celery into 3 or 4 pieces; place in the chicken cavity.

Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Remove from the oven and baste with drippings. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest for about 30 minutes before serving.

Store the (completely cooled) pulled pork in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days. You can freeze pulled pork for up to six months.

To ensure the pulled pork doesn’t dry out, we recommend reheating it in the oven or in the slow cooker instead of the microwave. Make sure to save the juices so you can reheat them with the pork.

“Excellent recipe,” according to kkingsley2. “Very delicious. I added some pepperoncini peppers and a few splashes of Frank's red hot sauce.”

“Oh my gosh!! The best I’ve ever had,” raves Jlynn. “Even my pickiest eater ate her whole sandwich and wanted more.”

Simple Macaroni and Cheese,https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/238691/simple-macaroni-and-cheese/,4,25,Dinner,4.5,"1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni
¼ cup butter
¼ cup all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon salt
  ground black pepper to taste
2 cups milk
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese","Looking for a homemade alternative to boxed mac and cheese that's just as quick and easy? This stovetop mac and cheese uses staple ingredients and comes together in just 25 minutes. You'll want to bookmark this recipe for busy weeknights. The good news is, it's so simple that once you make it a couple times, you'll likely have it memorized.

Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes.

Tip: For a thicker mac and cheese, double the amount of macaroni.

While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese.

To make the roux, start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. Be careful to not let the milk burn.

Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese.

Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated.

This stovetop mac and cheese is all about convenience, but if you find yourself with some extra time and a desire for bubbly, baked mac and cheese, you can bake this recipe.

To do so, complete the first three steps above, then top with any desired toppings such as bread crumbs, Parmesan, crushed crackers, etc. Bake at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) for about 15 minutes, or until golden-brown and bubbling.

Refrigerate leftover mac and cheese in an airtight container for three to four days. To reheat, stir in a splash of milk or cream and reheat in the microwave or on the stove, stirring periodically.

You can freeze mac and cheese for up to six months. Allow the mac and cheese to cool completely, then transfer to a freezer-safe bag, removing as much air as possible. Label with the date and freeze. When you're ready to serve, simply transfer the dish to the fridge to thaw overnight. Reheat as normal.

This is a great starter recipe that allows for endless customizations. Here are some add-in suggestions from Allrecipes reviewers:

""I added onion powder, Parmesan cheese and a little bit of cayenne pepper,"" says RRL.

""I always recommend using different cheeses for taste. I use white cheddar and four cheese Mexican blend together,"" says Angel.

""I like to add diced ham and peas or diced chicken and broccoli…"" says Fred Cannon.

""I added yellow mustard and topped with crushed Ritz crackers,"" says Memmere.

""This is a simple and creamy basic mac and cheese!"" says Allrecipes Allstar Christina. ""I used light Velveeta and 2 percent milk with great results. Very easy to put together, and a nice recipe to customize to your own tastes.""

""For a simple macaroni and cheese recipe as the title suggests, this recipe was fabulous!"" says reviewer Karli F. ""I'm throwing out my box macaroni!""

1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
  kosher salt to taste","If you've ever carved into a prime rib at a big holiday meal expecting a juicy, perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry, overcooked roast, this recipe is for you.

This simple, foolproof ""mathematical method"" for making the very best prime rib will greatly increase your chances of success. Here is the formula: Multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes. For me it was 5.35 x 5 = 26.75 minutes, which we round up to 27.

You'll cook your room-temperature prime rib at 500 degrees F for exactly that many minutes. (Twenty-seven minutes, in my case.) Then turn off the oven and wait 2 hours without opening the door. When the time's up, remove the prime rib and slice into the most perfectly medium-rare meat you've ever seen. See? That's all it takes to make foolproof prime rib cooked to a perfect pink that's somewhere just a shade under medium rare. Just make sure you're starting with a prime rib that has been brought to room temperature! This is critical in order for the math to work!Now, while the method could not be easier, there are a couple things that this method requires: a full-size, modern oven with a digital temperature setting that indicates when it is preheated. Older ovens with manual controls can vary greatly, and the doors may not have the proper insulation. Here's another pro tip for you: Because prime rib is expensive, you should always insert a probe-style thermometer to monitor the internal temp of your roast and avoid any chance of over-cooking. Set the probe alarm (125 F for medium-rare) just in case, and pull the prime rib from oven even if there's still time left on the oven timer.

Serve your prime rib with Chef John's Beef Au Jus. Enjoy!

""This is a fool proof method for making the best medium rare prime rib,"" says Haiku. ""Your seasonings can be changed according to your preference, but what's listed works perfectly. It's the cooking method that is the key. It cannot be stressed enough, the roast MUST be at room temperature in order for this to work. If it is the least bit cold in the middle of the roast, you will come out with a very rare roast. A mistake I only made once because I was worried about leaving it out to get warm. Don't worry! It will be fine! I usually purchase 4.5-to-5 pound roasts and take it out of the fridge for a minimum of 5 hours to be sure it is room temp. It comes out absolutely PERFECT and juicy every time.""

""I have used this recipe for years and it works perfectly,"" says Nancy. ""ONE THING that will cause the meat to be less than medium rare, besides not having the rib at room temperature, is the fan in newer ovens! I had no issue for many years until I got a new oven. Many new ovens have a fan that comes on when you turn the oven off. It quickly lowers the temp, which, obviously, will not work for this recipe. Since I have a built-in oven, I actually shut off the breaker to the oven so the fan doesn't come on. Otherwise you can just unplug it.""""Absolutely the easiest way to make perfect prime rib every time,"" raves Claudia B. ""But do not be tempted to open up the oven door until time is up!""

Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).

Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously with kosher salt.

Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If your roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.)

Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.

Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.

Try pairing this perfect prime rib with au jus and horseradish sauce.

Corned Beef and Cabbage,https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16310/corned-beef-and-cabbage-i/,6,120,Dinner,4.7,"1 (3 pound) corned beef brisket with spice packet
10 small red potatoes
5 medium carrots
1 large head cabbage","If you're looking for the best corned beef and cabbage recipe on the internet, you've come to the right place. You won't believe how simple it is to make this top-rated recipe. It's perfect for St. Patrick's Day, but you'll want to make it all year long.

Corned beef is salt-cured beef. Before electricity paved the way for refrigeration, meat was preserved in salt. Brisket (the tender meat from the lower breast) is traditionally used to make corned beef in the United States.

Learn more: What Is Corned Beef and Where Does It Come From?

So how did corned beef and cabbage become such a dynamic duo? It's actually an American invention. Historically, cabbage was paired with pork bacon in Ireland. Irish immigrants in 19th-century New York City, who often lived in the same neighborhood as Jewish butchers, noticed flavor similarities between the corned beef of NYC delicatessens and the pork bacon of their homeland. Thus, corned beef and cabbage was born. These days, it's commonly associated with St. Patrick's Day.

Corned beef and pastrami are both deli staples, but they're not the same thing. Corned beef is salt-cured beef that is cooked by boiling, while pastrami is seasoned and smoked beef.

Place corned beef and seasoning packet in a Dutch oven, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the meat is tender.

In the meantime, cut the red potatoes in half and cut the cabbage into wedges. Peel and cut the carrots.

When the meat is tender, add potatoes and carrots to the Dutch oven and cook until they're tender. Add the cabbage and cook for about 15 more minutes.

Remove the meat from the Dutch oven and let it rest for about 15 minutes. Slice across the grain and serve with vegetables and broth.

Store leftover corned beef and cabbage in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days. Reheat in the oven until the meat reaches a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees F.

Yes, you can freeze cooked corned beef and cabbage. Allow the dish to cool completely, then transfer in serving-size portions to zip-top freezer bags labeled with the date. Wrap each bag in a layer of aluminum foil for added protection.

Squeeze out all the excess air and freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight. Reheat in the oven until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F.

""This recipe is absolutely amazing,"" raves Ter. ""This will be my second time making this dish and I pretty much followed it exactly the way it states. The only thing I do different is, I add two whole onions when I put the corned beef in and leave them in the whole time for a little added flavor. This dish is definitely worth trying, you won't be disappointed!

""Simple is better,"" says Kieu Trang H. ""I made the dish according to the recipe, and it came out delicious. It was easy to make, and did not require a lot of prep work. This is going in my recipe collection for sure!""

""Followed the directions exactly, except for adding one can of beer with the water,"" according to tarajvern. ""Everything turned out fantastic! The meat was melt-in-your-mouth perfect!""

Homemade Dumplings,https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/6900/dumplings/,6,20,Dinner,4.7,"1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon white sugar
½ teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon margarine
½ cup milk","Have a hankering for light, fluffy, tender dumplings just like your mom used to make? You've come to the right place. These homemade dumplings are easy to make with just six pantry staples – and they're even easier to eat. With this top-rated recipe, you'll make perfect dumplings every time.

A dumpling is a small mass of dough that can be boiled, fried, baked, or steamed. There are a ton of dumpling varieties out there, from pork- and cabbage-filled Chinese dumplings to cheesy Polish dumplings.

These boiled drop dumplings, which are popular in the U.S., are often paired with chicken and broth to create a popular comfort food called chicken and dumplings.

They're prepared by dropping spoonfuls of dough into a pot of boiling soup or stew. The starch in the dumplings thickens the broth, resulting in a rich stew that's impossible to resist.

This recipe is made with just six ingredients you probably already have on hand.

FlourThese dumplings start with all-purpose flour, which creates structure and holds the other ingredients together.

Baking PowderBaking powder is a leavening agent, which means it releases gas that makes the dough expand. It's responsible for the dumplings' light and fluffy texture.

White SugarA teaspoon of sugar adds an extremely subtle hint of sweetness. It also helps the dumplings retain their moisture through the cooking process and slows gluten development, which ensures tender dumplings.

SaltA pinch of salt seasons the dumplings and enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.

Butter or MargarineCold butter or margarine is cut into the flour mixture to bind the dry ingredients together. It also keeps the dumplings light and tender.

MilkWhole milk helps create a smooth, moist dough.

To make sure a dumpling is done cooking, pierce it with a fork or toothpick. You'll know it's done when the fork or toothpick comes out clean.

You can store leftover cooked dumplings or dumpling soup in an airtight container in the fridge for two to three days. Reheat gently on the stove or in 10-second intervals in the microwave.

Some people like to freeze dumpling dough for quick and easy cooking.

It couldn't be easier: Just drop spoonfuls of dough onto a baking sheet, flash freeze for at least three hours or up to overnight, then transfer the now-frozen dough to a freezer-safe container or zip-top bag. Label with the date and freeze for about three months.

When it's time to use them, let the dumplings thaw for about 30 minutes and then drop them directly into the soup or stew.

""I have made the same old dumplings for years,"" says LIZ1888. ""I came upon this recipe and tried it. These were great! I made them for chicken and dumplings. They also thickened the sauce as they cooked.""

""The dumplings came out so light and fluffy and flavorful,"" according to ALISON K. ""I was searching for a dumpling recipe made from scratch instead of a mix and was so happy to find this one.""

""I topped a vegetable stew with these dumplings on a chilly autumn evening in Wisconsin,"" says Pam Westfall ""Oh yum! Truly delicious. The perfect comfort food!""

Stir together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl.

Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Stir in milk and mix until a batter forms that is thick enough to be scooped with a spoon. Allow batter to rest for 3 to 5 minutes.

Drop batter by spoonfuls into boiling stew or soup. Cover and simmer without lifting the lid for 15 minutes. Serve.

Serve hot and enjoy!

To make parsley dumplings, add 1 tablespoon parsley flakes to the dry ingredients.

A Sloppy Joe is a sandwich consisting of ground beef and onions in a tomato-based sauce served on a hamburger bun.

The sandwich likely originated in Sioux City, Iowa in the 1930s. According to legend, the ""loose meat sandwich"" was the creation of a cook named Joe.

You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make these classic Sloppy Joes:

1. Cook the beef, onion, and green pepper.2. Drain the liquids, then stir in the remaining ingredients.3. Simmer for about 30 minutes. Serve on hamburger buns.

""There's no need to pull out any of that canned stuff,"" according to Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom), who says you've already got everything you need to make a perfect Sloppy Joe sitting in your pantry. Here are a few of her favorite Sloppy Joe tips and tricks:

· Nicole doesn't like to drain the meat after she cooks it (she likes to use the rendered fat to saute the onions and bell peppers), so she prefers using a lean meat.· ""When it comes to the bun,"" Nicole says, ""the cheaper the better."" For the classic Sloppy Joe experience, you want it to absorb all the excess liquid.· Make sure to overfill the bun so that some meat spills out. Why? So you can scoop it up with potato chips, of course!

Recipe creator Tamara suggests serving these Sloppy Joe sandwiches with homemade sweet potato fries. They also pair well with all kinds of diner-style side dishes! For instance:

""I wanted a Sloppy Joe recipe that was quick and easy, a little sweet, but not unbearably sweet,"" says momof2ingeorgia. ""This was AWESOME! I make it once every 2 weeks. Quick and easy, especially on a day when we have soccer practices!""

""Great balance of flavors and as easy as opening a canned mix,"" according to WithaC. ""I've made it exactly as described and also in the Crock-Pot (brown and drain the beef first). This is now a family favorite.""

""Terrific recipe,"" raves steve22. ""Ended up using ground venison instead of beef. Couldn't tell the difference. Will definitely make again. Quick and easy.""

Roasted Pork Loin,https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21766/roasted-pork-loin/,8,60,Dinner,4.5,"3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon dried rosemary
  salt and pepper to taste
2 pounds boneless pork loin roast
¼ cup olive oil
½ cup white wine","If you're tired of dry and boring pork loin, then this is the recipe for you. Not only is this Roasted Pork Loin heavily seasoned with garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper, but it's also basted every 30 minutes with an olive oil and white wine pan sauce. So, if you're looking for a way to use that boneless pork loin, this recipe will yield the perfect juicy and flavorful result that no one will be able to resist.

Don't get confused by their similar names, pork loin and pork tenderloin are actually two different cuts of meat. The pork loin is wider, shorter, and flatter and comes from the back of the pig. Pork loins can be boneless or bone-in. While the pork tenderloin is long and narrow and comes from the muscle that runs down the pig's backbone. Pork tenderloins are always boneless.

You may also see pork loins called pork loin roast, center-cut pork roast, center-cut pork loin roast, center-cut rib roast, center loin roast, or pork loin rib half.

There are a few methods for cooking pork loin. The easiest way is to roast it in the oven, like in this recipe. Make sure to consistently baste your pork loin while it cooks to keep the meat juicy and allow it to soak up all the flavors. Then serve the roast with the extra pan sauce as well.

You can also quickly pan-sear your pork loin first before roasting it in the oven for a light crisp on the outside. Or, take your pork loin outside and grill it over medium heat.

Learn more: How to Cook Pork

A good rule of thumb is to cook pork loin 25 minutes per pound at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). The internal temperature should be at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), so use a thermometer to know when it's done.

The National Pork Board recommends the following cooking times for roasting pork loin at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) in the oven:

New York Pork Roast (2 pounds): 26-28 minutes per poundNew York Pork Roast (3-5 pounds): 20-25 minutes per poundSirloin Pork Roast (2 pounds): 26-28 minutes per poundSirloin Pork Roast (3-5 pounds): 20-25 minutes per poundPork Crown Roast: 12-15 minutes per poundRack of Pork: 25-40 minutes per poundSirloin Pork Roast: 25-40 pounds per pound

You'll want to let your pork loin rest at least three minutes before serving. But, if you can wait longer, resting for about 10 to 15 minutes will result in an even juicier roast. As your pork loin rests, it will continue to cook more so use a thermometer to check the internal temperature for the level of doneness you want.

Medium-Rare: 145-150 degrees F (63-66 degrees C)Medium: 150-155 degrees F (66-69 degrees C)Medium-Well: 155-160 degrees F (69-72 degrees C)Well: 160 degrees F (72 degrees C)

""This roast was excellent! I followed the directions exactly and it was so flavorful. As an added bonus our house smelled wonderful, too! It did not take as long to cook as it said, though. Next time I will check the roast at an hour and a half,"" says Sarah Paul.

""We really liked this. It came out great. I'm not the best cook, but this was easy. It was tender and flavorful, the best pork roast I ever had. Since there were only two of us, we had leftovers, but not much. We mixed the leftovers with veggies and cream of chicken soup and served over noodles as a meal.

  salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 large eggs
1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed
¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed
½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed
½ cup prepared tomato sauce
¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes
¼ cup chopped fresh basil
½ cup grated provolone cheese
2 teaspoons olive oil","Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.

In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that way, not with this method.

Unlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the chicken with sauce and cheese. The key to great non-soggy chicken Parmesan? Don't put any sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a little bit of sauce on top, so the breading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot of sauce on your chicken Parmesan, that's fine, you can always serve extra sauce on the side. I also use some actual Parmesan cheese in this recipe! Curiously, most versions of chicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. Here, I'm going with a delicious mixture of fresh mozzarella, tangy Provolone and real Parmesan.

Another little trick I employ here is to add some grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, which adds another layer of flavor. You'll fry the breadcrumb and Parmesan crusted chicken breasts just to golden brown before transferring them to a baking pan and adding sauce (but not too much!), cheese, and herbs. Okay, now let's break it down.

Before we get to the recipe, here's your cheat sheet for making the best baked chicken Parmesan:

Now find out the best wine to pair with your non-soggy, not-too-saucy baked chicken Parmesan. Enjoy!

""Perfectly delicious and beautiful just as instructed!"" says angie. ""As the video explains, too much sauce and/or cheese only takes away from the flavor — I learned this by experience. I suggest having additional sauce and/or cheese available if guests choose to add more on their plate, but personally think less is more in this case.""

""This recipe delivers!"" raves deneice knotts. ""This was SO easy. My chicken was juicy and crunchy plus the cheesy goodness. YUM!! My son said this 'slaps,' which means it's one of the best things he has ever tasted. Thanks! I'll make this again without being afraid of dry chicken.""

""A wonder of wonders!"" raves Joe. ""Watch the vid! Chef John has some cost-effective tips on flouring your chicken. As well as seasoning the chicken, instead of the flour, eggs, and panko. You will never do it any other way again. Two things I changed was to use my wife's spaghetti sauce. Of course. The other was to use Italian seasoning instead of fresh basil, which was not at hand. We WILL be making this again and again.""

Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).

Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.

Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides

Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.

Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.

Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.

Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.

Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.

Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Cast Iron Pan-Seared Steak (Oven-Finished),https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/262181/cast-iron-pan-seared-steak-oven-finished/,2,60,Dinner,4.5,"2 (6 ounce) beef top sirloin steaks
2 cups orange juice
1 cup apple cider vinegar
½ cup Worcestershire sauce
1 ½ tablespoons steak seasoning (such as Fiesta Brand® Uncle Chris'), or to taste
  freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 teaspoons olive oil
  sea salt to taste","If you're making steaks inside, you've come to the right place. This technique for cooking steak in a cast iron skillet is unbeatable. What sets it apart? It starts on the stove in a cast iron skillet, but you'll finish the steak in the oven. The stovetop-to-oven method produces steaks with a deeply caramelized crust and a tender, perfectly cooked interior.

We love this oven-finished steak recipe for a lot of reasons. To name a few:

The skillet is the star of the show. Why? Cast iron absorbs and retains heat like no other surface. It heats up fast and cooks evenly. A hot cast iron skillet puts a quick sear on steaks, creating a beautiful caramelized crust, without overcooking the center of the steak. Also, the cast iron skillet goes from stovetop to oven with ease.

This recipe calls for beef top-sirloin steaks. Choose steaks that are at least 1-inch thick. If the steak is too thin, the inside will overcook before the beautiful caramelized crust can form on the outside. Of course, this stovetop-to-oven technique works well for more expensive cuts, too.

Allrecipes community member Ken Turnbull loves the technique for thick steaks with nice marbling: ""I learned this method from a good steak house almost 50 years ago and always have the best results,"" he says.

This simple steak recipe calls for marinating your top-sirloin steaks in a simple marinade made up of common ingredients you likely have on hand: Orange juice, cider vinegar, olive oil, and Worcestershire sauce.

The ideal steak marinades are simple mixtures of acid (OJ and cider), fat (olive oil), and seasonings (Worcestershire sauce). The acid tenderizes the meat and delivers a tangy flavor foundation; the fat binds the marinade and helps prevent steaks from sticking; and the seasonings, well, they add flavor.

Let the steaks sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute. As your steaks rest, they will also continue to cook slightly. For best results, use a meat thermometer to test for doneness. Here is what you're aiming for:

Rare: 125 degrees F (52 degrees C)Medium Rare: 130 degrees F (54 degrees C)Medium: 140 degrees F (60 degrees C)Medium Well: 150 degrees F (65 degrees C)Well Done: 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)

""The outside had a perfect crust and inside it was extremely juicy and tender,"" says Jeffrey Klotzbach. ""I would recommend it to anyone.""

""A 1-inch thick steak is as thin as you want to go,"" says Ken Turnbull. ""For medium rare, I find that between 1 and 2 minutes per side is all that is needed for the sear and that 5 minutes in a 425 degree oven is enough, if not too much, for a 1-inch steak.""

""I used a 1-pound petite sirloin and splashed a little Pinot Noir in the pan drippings while the steak was resting,"" says rennhr. ""Then I reduced the sauce and finished with unsalted butter. Will definitely make again.""

Bake in the preheated oven until steaks are firm and reddish-pink to lightly pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read from 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).

Remove steaks from oven; season with salt. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.

Enjoy!

Quick Beef Stir-Fry,https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/228823/quick-beef-stir-fry/,4,25,Dinner,4.4,"2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound beef sirloin, cut into 2-inch strips
1 ½ cups fresh broccoli florets
1  red bell pepper, cut into matchsticks
2  carrots, thinly sliced
1  green onion, chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted","Need to use up some of your leftover vegetables and other pantry staple ingredients? Look no further than a classic beef stir-fry. This beef and broccoli stir-fry comes together in just 25 minutes and only requires ingredients that you probably already have. And if you don't? You can just skip them!

This dish is packed with veggies, beef, and saucy flavors for a weeknight dinner warrior that checks all the boxes. Served with rice or lo mein noodles, this will be the best beef stir-fry you've ever made.

The most time-consuming part of making stir-fry is all the chopping. Slicing your meat and veggies into smaller bite-sized pieces can take a little bit of time and effort, but it's worth it for the end result.

After you've chopped all your ingredients, you'll cook the beef on one side of the wok, or another large frying pan, and the veggies on the other side of the wok. Once they're all cooked, you can mix the two sides together and add the soy sauce and sesame seeds.

Some stir-fry recipes use a specific stir-fry sauce, which can be as basic as broth, soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine vinegar. This quick stir-fry calls for only soy sauce. But you can feel free to add a stir-fry sauce or marinate your beef in one if you prefer.

Flank steaks are the most popular choice for making a stir-fry. However, you can also use sirloin steak, skirt steak, Denver steak, or even beef chuck.

Beef chuck steak is the most economical choice, but it does require some extra trimming. You'll want to remove the tough tissue from the steaks before frying.

If possible, you should use a wok to make beef stir-fry. Woks are large and have sloping sides that let you cook the entire stir-fry in one pan, so you can easily stir and flip the food without fear of it flying out. They also are designed to cook foods quicker than skillets and with less oil.

If you can't use a wok (or another carbon steel pan) then any skillet will work. You may just need to cook the meat and veggies in separate batches.

When cooking, make sure you heat the pan and oil up first before adding your ingredients — they should sizzle as soon as they hit the heat. And always use an oil with a high smoke point, like canola or peanut oil, for the best stir-fry results.

""I added this recipe to my favorites list not even a month ago and I have made this, using different variations every time, at least 5 times. My family loves this recipe and I've paired it with rice or noodles and it always pleases. I usually use beef stew meat and switch up the vegetables. I would definitely recommend this recipe for anybody that's pressed for time and wants to make a quick easy meal that the whole family will enjoy,"" says Tiana Marie Ginorio.

""Hubby and I both liked this. It's very easy to make and is ready in no time. I used flank steak instead of sirloin and I didn't have any green onions, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written. We both though it needed a bit of something, so after the first few bites we added some crushed chilis for a bit of heat,"" adds Allrecipes Allstar France C.

""Made it true to the recipe except that I only used half of a red bell pepper because it was what I had. The dish didn't suffer at all for it and the spiciness was just right for me. Served over rice and was the best quick meal that I made this week,"" raves Shoebox.

Smoking results in an aromatic bird with a delicate, smoky flavor and a beautifully tender and juicy texture. Learn how to smoke a turkey, and get our best seasoning and storage tips, right here.

It's easier than you think to make a perfectly smoked turkey. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

How long to smoke a turkey depends on multiple factors, including the size of the turkey and the type of smoker. When you cook it according to this recipe, a 10-pound turkey should be done in about 5 hours.

You'll know the turkey is done when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, reads at least 180 degrees F.

For this recipe, you'll preheat your smoker to 225 to 250 degrees F. Low and slow smoking ensures a juicy texture and perfect flavor.

We don't recommend smoking a frozen turkey, as a frozen bird may not cook evenly (which may cause foodborne illness). Make sure your turkey is completely thawed before smoking.

Learn more: How to Safely Thaw a Frozen Turkey

The outside of this smoked turkey is simply seasoned with garlic and salt. The cavity is stuffed with a variety of ingredients (cola, apple, onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper) to infuse the bird with irresistible flavor from the inside out.

When it comes to smoking a turkey, brining is completely optional. The low and slow cooking actually draws the moisture into the turkey instead of out, so you don't need to add anything to keep it juicy. This top-rated recipe doesn't require a brine.

Of course, the smoked turkey will be the star of your holiday table. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't leave room for sides! Peruse these collections to complete your holiday meal:

Store leftover smoked turkey in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat until warmed through in the microwave, in the oven, or on the stove.

""I absolutely love this recipe, it is always my family's favorite way of eating our Thanksgiving turkey,"" says Sabrina Leigh Millward. ""It always turns out so juicy with so much flavor!! I love to save the bones and make the best bone broth.""

""This was delicious, better than deep-fried,"" according to MichaelORO. ""The skin is perfect, the meat is moist, and the flavor is consistent throughout.""

""This was an excellent recipe for smoked turkey,"" raves Tammy. ""The flavors blended together nicely. We smoked it with an apple juice/water mixture. We used a Granny Smith apple in the cavity with the other ingredients. Very little leftovers.""

Preheat a smoker to 225 to 250 degrees F (110 to 120 degrees C).

Rinse turkey under cold water, and pat dry.

Rub crushed garlic over the outside of the turkey, and sprinkle with seasoned salt. Transfer to a disposable roasting pan.

Fill the turkey cavity with butter, cola, apple, onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cover turkey loosely with foil.

Add wood chips to the smoker according to the manufacturer's directions. Place the roasting pan in the preheated smoker. Smoke the turkey, basting every 1 to 2 hours with juices from the bottom of the roasting pan, for 5 hours.

Add more wood chips if desired. Continue smoking and basting, until turkey is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 5 more hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).

This flavorful, juicy Thanksgiving turkey is seasoned from the inside out: The cavity is stuffed with an herbaceous mixture of dried parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, lemon-pepper seasoning, and salt. The Champagne and chicken broth, which are poured over the turkey before roasting to keep the meat incredibly moist and juicy, also add irresistible flavor.

If you follow this recipe with a 15-pound turkey, your Thanksgiving centerpiece should be fully cooked after about 3.5 hours in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F.

We recommend cooking an unstuffed turkey for about 13-15 minutes per pound. This 15-pound turkey should be fully cooked within about 3.5 hours — but you should always check the internal temperature before serving to prevent food poisoning.

Turkey may or may not have been on the menu at the 1621 harvest meal that Americans call the First Thanksgiving. In fact, experts think venison was likely the star of the show.

The roasted turkey had become synonymous with Thanksgiving until the 1800s, when savvy poultry producers launched a post-Civil War marketing campaign that prompted people to eat more turkey — especially around the holidays.

½ teaspoon salt-free garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash)
  salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (3 pound) turkey breast with skin
1 teaspoon minced shallot
1 tablespoon butter
1 splash dry white wine
1 cup chicken stock
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons half-and-half (Optional)","Feeling the pressure to roast a whole bird this Thanksgiving? We're here to tell you that roasting a turkey breast gives you the same great flavor, while saving you money, fridge space, and effort.

A turkey breast is generally sized to feed two to three people with leftovers, so it's the perfect choice for a scaled-down celebration.

This oven-roasted turkey breast is slathered with an herb butter both underneath and on top of the skin, yielding juicy, flavorful meat and a crispy skin. Be sure to save the drippings for the accompanying turkey gravy!

We're partial to bone-in turkey breast because it yields more flavorful, juicier meat. Bone-in turkey breasts tend to be larger and can be sold as a half breast or a full breast (two halves joined at the bone). Boneless turkey breasts typically feature just one breast. You can use boneless in this recipe if you want (we'd still recommend skin-on), but you'll likely need to decrease the cooking time to accommodate for its smaller size.

As a rule of thumb, plan to purchase 1 ½ pounds of turkey per person with leftovers or 1 pound of turkey per person without leftovers.

This recipe calls for a 3-pound turkey breast, which will easily feed two to three adults, although you can scale it up or down as needed. For more, check out our handy turkey serving size chart.

In general, you'll want to cook a bone-in turkey breast for about 20 minutes per pound at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C), or until it reaches a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

To temp the turkey, insert an instant-read meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast, not touching the bone. Be sure to allow the turkey to rest for 10-15 minutes before serving so the juices have to settle into the meat.

If you do end up with leftovers, there are countless ways to repurpose roasted turkey breast. Add it to casseroles like this Easy Turkey Tetrazzini or sandwiches like this Thanksgiving Sandwich. Browse our entire collection of leftover turkey recipes.

""So much easier than cooking the whole bird, and not a scrap was leftover,"" says reviewer Peter Downing.

""The gravy was especially good — I did use all the drippings instead of just a tablespoon and that was a good thing as my family finished it all!"" says reviewer tmtorby.

""I also roasted it over some veggies: an onion, celery and parsnips. Everything including the gravy was delicious!"" says reviewer msteingold.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Mix 1/4 cup butter, garlic, paprika, Italian seasoning, garlic and herb seasoning, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.

Place turkey breast with skin-side up into a roasting pan. Loosen skin with your fingers; brush 1/2 of the butter mixture over the turkey breast and underneath the skin. Reserve remaining butter mixture. Tent turkey breast loosely with aluminum foil.

Roast in the preheated oven for 1 hour; baste turkey breast with remaining butter mixture. Return to oven and roast until the juices run clear and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast, not touching bone, reads 165 degrees F (65 degrees C), about 30 more minutes. Let turkey breast rest 10 to 15 minutes before serving.

While turkey is resting, transfer pan drippings to a skillet. Skim off excess grease, leaving about 1 tablespoon in skillet. Place skillet over low heat; cook and stir shallot in turkey grease until opaque, about 5 minutes.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in skillet with shallot and whisk in white wine, scraping any browned bits of food from skillet. Whisk in chicken stock and flour until smooth. Bring to a simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened. For a creamier, lighter gravy, whisk in half-and-half.

You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the Italian meatball recipe below, but let's go over the basics:

These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this Italian meatball recipe:

Notes from Chef John:

Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade Italian meatballs:

Chef John suggests serving the Italian meatballs with homemade tomato sauce and polenta. They also work well as an appetizer, in a sandwich, or served over mashed potatoes, rice, or egg noodles.

Store your leftover Italian meatballs in a shallow, airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days.

Yes, Italian meatballs freeze well. Flash freeze the cooked meatballs on a baking sheet for a few hours or up to overnight, then transfer the frozen meatballs to a freezer-safe container. Freeze for up to three months.

If you prefer, you can also freeze the meatballs before cooking. You can easily cook them from-frozen on the stove whenever you want to whip up a quick dish.

“The meatballs are wonderful,” raves Andrea Wojack. “We are kicking ourselves that we didn’t make a double batch! But how could we know they’d be so full of flavor, so juicy, so tender?”

“This is my go-to meatball recipe,” says one Allrecipes community member. “The meatballs come out perfectly each and every time that I make them. They bake perfectly and I believe that refrigerating the mixed ingredients is the key. The texture is perfect and the flavor is delicious.”

“These meatballs are the best I ever made,” according to Kay. “My husband loved them. I used an ice cream scoop to make them and they were a perfect size. The texture was very moist and they had great flavor.”

Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring until onion is very tender, about 15 minutes more.

Gently stir beef and pork together in a large bowl. Add onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes; mix together using a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Form mixture into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter; arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.

Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.

Some recipes use equal portions of beef, veal, and pork, which is also nice, yet more expensive. These days you can find all sorts of lean-to-fat ratios for ground beef. Most stores sell 90% lean, 10% fat, but I prefer the 80% lean, 20% fat ratio for this recipe.

You can substitute water or beef broth for the milk if preferred.

Serve with homemade tomato sauce and polenta.

You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe with detailed instructions below — but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make tuna casserole:

You don’t necessarily need to serve tuna casserole with anything since it’s quite filling all on its own. However, a nice salad would pair well with this hearty dish. Explore our collection of Quick and Easy Side Dish Salads for delicious inspiration.

Tuna casserole is easy to prepare in advance. We suggest assembling the casserole the day before you plan to serve it, covering the dish with storage wrap or foil, and storing the unbaked casserole in the fridge overnight. Bake it according to the recipe right before serving.

Store your leftover tuna casserole in a shallow, airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the oven or in the microwave.

If you plan to freeze tuna casserole, go ahead and make it in a foil pan. Allow the casserole to cool, then wrap the whole thing in storage wrap. Wrap it again in a layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then reheat in the oven or microwave.

“My family loved it,” says Christel Thomas. “Everyone had seconds. The only change I made was to toast some bread crumbs for the topping instead of using potato chips.”

“This tuna casserole was definitely worth making and tasted even better the next day,” according to BSetterberg. “The tuna wasn't over powering and the casserole had loads of flavor. It tasted great with chips, but I plan to try crushed Ritz crackers instead next time.”“This recipe is very easy and uses ingredients that can be kept on hand for a last minute dinner,” raves one Allrecipes community member.

Roast Spatchcock Turkey,https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/245534/roast-spatchcock-turkey/,10,120,Dinner,4.9,"1 (10 pound) whole turkey
½ cup olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon crushed black pepper","Never made a spatchcocked turkey for Thanksgiving? This is your year. Spatchcocking a turkey results in a wonderfully juicy and evenly cooked bird in a fraction of the time.

To ""spatchcock"" means to remove a bird's backbone so that it will lay flat while cooking. This method (also known as butterflying) ensures even cooking, juicier meat, and a quicker cooking time. Why? All the turkey parts are exposed to the same amount of heat for the same duration of time, so you don't have to wait around for the thighs to finish cooking while the breast gets dry.

These are the ingredients you'll need to make this absolutely amazing roasted spatchcock turkey:

It's easier than you think to spatchcock a turkey. You'll find the step-by-step instructions below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

Once the turkey is spatchcocked, it's a pretty straightforward process. Again, you'll find the full recipe below — but here's a quick preview:

Place the turkey on a roasting rack and rub it all over with oil. Season with sage, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Roast in a preheated oven for about 90 minutes, rotating every 30 minutes. Increase the temperature and continue roasting until the skin is crispy and golden.

This recipe should result in a perfectly cooked 10-pound turkey after about an hour and 45 minutes of roasting. You'll need to adjust the roasting time for larger or smaller birds.

Of course, you'll need to take the turkey's internal temperature before serving. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 165 degrees F.

""When you use this method, there's no waking up at 6 a.m. to get the turkey in the oven,"" according to culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). ""It only takes a couple of hours and dinner is served."" Here are a few of her favorite tips for making a roasted spatchcock turkey:

""I love making a turkey this way,"" says Sue. ""I place my turkey on a bed of thickly sliced onions and celery placed on the bottom of the baking sheet instead of on a rack. I also add just a bit of chicken broth to the pan.""

""I had to wrestle a little bit to get the backbone out, but it's worth it,"" according to Debra Stevens. ""Juicy white meat that the family raved about.""

""The skin was perfectly crisp and I was super stoked that I was able to make the gravy in advance with the backbone and neck,"" raves Allrecipes Allstar Elizabeth. ""This is my new favorite way to make my bird!!""

Editorial contributions by Corey Williams

Gather ingredients.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a roasting rack on a baking sheet.

Place turkey, breast-side down, on a cutting board. Using a pair of sharp heavy-duty kitchen shears, cut along one side of the backbone.

Repeat on the other side of the backbone. Remove backbone and reserve for making turkey stock for gravy.

Press firmly down onto both sides of turkey to flatten.

Flip turkey breast-side up and put on the roasting rack. Tuck wing tips under turkey (behind breast). Pat skin dry and rub olive oil over entire turkey. Season with sage, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper.

Roast in the preheated oven for 1 hour 30 minutes, rotating the baking sheet every 30 minutes.

Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and continue to roast until skin is crisp and golden, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Remove turkey from the oven, cover loosely with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.

Serve hot and enjoy!

¼ cup olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
1  green bell pepper, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
6 cups water
2  bay leaves
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
¼ teaspoon dried sage
1 pound andouille sausage, sliced
4 cups water
2 cups long grain white rice","Looking for a hearty rice dish with a kick? This authentic Louisiana red beans and rice is a budget-friendly recipe with incredible Cajun flavor. Andouille sausage joins garden-fresh vegetables, zesty spices, and long grain rice in this deliciously down-home recipe. Learn all about this boldly savory dish, including tips on choosing the best beans and what to serve alongside it.

This multifaceted Louisiana-style red beans and rice recipe is made easier by breaking down the prep into small steps. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

Start by soaking your beans overnight, and dicing any vegetables beforehand.

When you're ready to begin, transfer the soaked beans to a large pot with water. Then, saute onions, bell peppers, garlic, and celery in an oiled skillet until a bit of color appears. Add the cooked vegetables, bay leaves, Cajun seasoning, and other spices to the beans.

Bring the bean mixture to a boil before reducing the heat and allowing the ingredients to simmer for two to two and a half hours. Steam the rice during this time and set it aside. Add Andouille sausage to the beans and cook for an additional half-hour. After cooking, pour the spicy sausage and beans over rice, and enjoy a piping hot bowl of tender, meaty, and flavorful perfection.

Red beans and kidney beans share a similar color, but they're actually two different types of legumes. Red beans are small, rounded, and have a faintly nutty taste. Red kidney beans are larger in size, with thicker skin and a slightly richer hue.

Both can be used to make an appetizing red beans and rice dish, but dried kidney beans may have to soak longer before cooking. Using dry beans in this recipe ensures that they retain their shape during cooking.

Dried beans should be soaked prior to cooking for easier digestion and faster cook time. There are two commonly used ways to soak beans: overnight or quick soak. The overnight method is incredibly simple — add beans to a large stockpot and cover them with twice their volume in water. Cover and let sit overnight.

Quick soaking consists of bringing dried beans and water to a boil before removing them from heat and allowing the beans to sit for one to four hours (or until they're easily squeezed).

Red beans and rice is a versatile recipe that can act as a main or side dish. The big, hearty flavors pair well with foods like cornbread, collard greens, barbecued meats, and fried chicken.

Leftover red beans should be stored separately from rice to discourage mushiness. Place both components in their own sealed container and refrigerate for up to a week.

To freeze your leftovers, place cooled, single servings of rice into freezer bags and top with a commensurate portion of beans. Tightly seal the bags, and freeze for up to three months.

""I'm a Louisiana boy who grew up eating red beans and rice, shares reviewer jChase. ""This recipe is the real deal. It's become a staple in my home and I serve it up twice a month.""

""I made substitutions because I did not want to venture out to the market for ingredients I did not have,"" says home cook Rea. ""This time, I used chorizo sausage, celery powder, and green pepper from my garden. I recommend it as-is, or with personal adjustments!""

""All I can say is wow!"" raves Lesley. ""I served half that night for dinner (over white jasmine rice) and the rest I froze in individual servings for a later date. A 5-star recipe for sure!""

1 pinch kosher salt and freshly ground pepper

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
¼ cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste","This quick and easy shrimp scampi pasta recipe is an Allrecipes fan-favorite, with more than one thousand ratings and hundreds of reviews. And it's ready to serve in only 40 minutes. Read on to get tips to make the best shrimp scampi with pasta — it's a top-rated recipe that's simple enough for weeknight dinners and fancy enough for a dinner party.

Shrimp scampi is a seafood dish made of shrimp cooked in a butter, garlic, and white wine sauce. You can serve shrimp scampi by itself as an appetizer or over pasta as a main dish.

· Shrimp: Choose large shrimp (31 to 35 shrimp per pound) to get best results for this recipe. You can buy fresh shrimp and peel and devein it yourself, or buy frozen shrimp. Thaw frozen shrimp before using.· Pasta: This recipe uses a 16-ounce package of linguine, but you can substitute the pasta of your choice, like angel hair pasta, fettuccine, or spaghetti.· Butter: Use unsalted butter. You can add salt to taste later in the recipe.· Extra-virgin olive oil: The flavor of the olive oil comes through in this recipe, so use the best quality.· Shallots and garlic: These aromatics add flavor and fragrance to shrimp scampi.· White wine: Use a dry, crisp white wine for shrimp scampi sauce. Pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc are good choices, and you can drink the leftover wine with dinner.· Lemon juice: Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best flavor.· Seasonings: Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper amplify the flavors, and a pinch of dried red pepper flakes give shrimp scampi a subtle kick. Use more red pepper flakes if you like things a bit more spicy.· Parsley: Fresh parsley adds eye-catching color and a bright, peppery flavor.

The full recipe directions are below, but here are top tips for recipe success:

· Prep ahead: Have all of your ingredients prepared and ready to cook before heating your skillet. You don't want to have to pause to cut, chop, squeeze, or measure right in the middle of a fast-moving recipe. If you use fresh shrimp, you can peel and devein the shrimp earlier in the day, then keep it chilled in the refrigerator until you're ready to get cooking.· Cook the pasta first: Boil the pasta in well-salted water, drain, and hold aside before cooking the shrimp scampi. You'll add the pasta to the hot skillet to warm it before serving. Time your cooking so you're ready to start cooking the shrimp immediately after the pasta is drained; you don't want the pasta to sit for too long.· Don't overcook the shrimp: It takes just a couple of minutes to cook raw shrimp, and if they cook for too long, shrimp turn tough and rubbery. You'll know the shrimp are close to done when they start to curl into a C shape and turn from translucent gray to opaque pink and white.

What does culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom) love about this restaurant-worthy shrimp scampi recipe? ""Not only is it easy and cheaper to make at home, but it can be on your table in just 30 minutes."" Plus, it's made with very few ingredients — so the shrimp can be the star of the show. Here are a few of her favorite tips:

· Nicole uses linguine because she likes a hearty bite. However, if you're craving something more delicate, use angel hair.· Don't drain all your pasta water! Reserve about one cup, as it might be your secret weapon later. If the finished dish looks a little dry, stir in some of the water. ""This will make your shrimp scampi a little saucier,"" Nicole says.· Serve the shrimp scampi with a loaf of crusty bread to soak up all that delicious sauce.

Allrecipes community member hurwitchestelle says, ""This was so yummy. I served it at lunch for a friend, and we both absolutely loved it. Although I often adjust recipes, I made it exactly as listed here, and I added pasta water as others suggested. I prepped everything ahead, even squeezing the lemon and having kosher salt ready. Doing that helped me feel comfortable in cooking this for my friend's lunch. This will now be a favorite company dish!""

""Absolutely amazing,"" raves pamster6451. ""This was our wedding night dinner at our hotel restaurant in 1979. We both loved it so much we've been trying recipes since. This one nailed it! It's a keeper. I used angel hair in place of linguini and it was a perfect substitute.""

""Family really loved this,"" according to reviewer Nancy Moser Franger. ""We had a pound of precooked shrimp and wanted to use it with pasta, so when the onions, garlic were done sauteing I added the cooked shrimp and mixed enough without overcooking. Turned out perfect.""

Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this tuna steak recipe:

On an outdoor grill preheated to high heat, the marinated tuna steaks should be perfectly grilled after about 5-6 minutes on each side. A meat thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 125 degrees F.

“I didn't have OJ so I substituted fresh-squeezed apple juice from wild apples I had picked last month,” says jeraldo. “Tuna came out moist, flavorful — perfect. Easy to make too.”

“Perfect,” raves Melissa Santos. “My family loves to fish and tuna season lasts a lot of the summer. We were looking for a new recipe and this was yummy! I doubled the marinade for about 10 steaks and let it sit for about 45 mins.”

“This was amazing as-is,” according to KSBARNES. “No adjustments are needed. I actually cooked on my stovetop, as I was in a hurry, and it came out perfectly!”

Editorial contributions by Corey Williams

Mix orange juice, soy sauce, olive oil, parsley, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, and pepper together in a large non-reactive dish until well combined. Place tuna steaks in marinade and turn to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove tuna steaks from the marinade and shake off excess; reserve marinade for basting.

Cook tuna steaks on the preheated grill for 5 to 6 minutes; flip steaks and baste with reserved marinade. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, or to desired doneness. Discard any remaining marinade.

Spicy Thai Basil Chicken (Pad Krapow Gai),https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/257938/spicy-thai-basil-chicken-pad-krapow-gai/,2,25,Dinner,4.8,"⅓ cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce, or as needed
2 teaspoons fish sauce
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon brown sugar
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped
¼ cup sliced shallots
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper
1 cup very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves
2 cups hot cooked rice","Allrecipes home cooks give a solid 5-star rating to Chef John's easy-to-make version of Thai basil chicken (pad krapow gai), a popular Thai restaurant-worthy dish that's ready in less than 30 minutes. In his easy and accessible style, Chef John walks you through the recipe ingredients and shows you how to build layers of flavor using simple cooking techniques.

""I don't cook Thai food at home often, mostly because there are at least a dozen such restaurants within walking distance, but when I do, there's nothing I enjoy more than this spicy Thai basil chicken,"" says Chef John.

Thai basil chicken is a stir-fry dish made with finely chopped or ground chicken cooked with chile peppers, garlic, and shallots, and seasoned with a sweet and salty sauce and finished with fresh basil. It's a classic dish in Thai cuisine and can be found in restaurants and as a popular street food.

SauceChicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar are whisked together to make a sweet and salty mixture to flavor the recipe.

ChickenChef John minces skinless, boneless chicken thigh until they're very finely chopped. You could use packaged ground chicken to speed up the process, but chopping or grinding your own gives you superior flavor and texture.

Shallots and garlicSliced shallots and minced garlic add another layer of flavor.

Hot chile peppersThis is where the heat comes into play. Use Thai chile, serrano chile, or other hot pepper of your choice, and customize the amount to suit your tolerance for heat.

BasilThis recipe traditionally uses Thai basil or ""holy"" basil, which have their own distinctive flavors. Chef John uses sweet basil, which is more readily available in most grocery stores. In the recipe video, Chef John demonstrates how he stacks and rolls basil leaves like a cigar to quickly slice thin ribbons that cook faster and impart flavor throughout the dish.

""No, I didn't use the real ""holy"" basil,"" says Chef John. ""But even with regular basil, this simple recipe is spectacular. Aromatic basil is the perfect herb for pairing with the slightly sweet, sort of salty, and possibly spicy, chopped meat.""

There are more than 100 varieties of basil, all of which are members of the mint family, and each variety has its own flavor. Thai basil has a mildly spicy licorice or anise seed flavor. Sweet basil (also known as Italian basil) tastes sweet and peppery. Holy basil (also called Thai holy basil) tastes of pepper and cloves.

Read more: What's the Difference Between Thai Basil, Sweet Basil, and Holy Basil?

Chef John recommends you prep all the ingredients before you start cooking because once you start the stir-fry, it all comes together very quickly. Prep takes about 15 minutes and cooking time is a speedy 10 minutes. If you want to serve the chicken with steamed rice, time your cooking accordingly.

To get started, you'll add the oil and minced chicken to a smoking-hot skillet and cook the chicken briefly for a couple of minutes. Next, you'll add the shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies, and cook for another couple of minutes. About a tablespoon of the sauce goes in next to cook for a minute with the chicken until it starts to caramelize on the skillet. Finally, you add the rest of the sauce, scraping up the caramelization and coating the chicken for another minute. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the basil until it's wilted from the residual heat. Now your Thai Basil Chicken is ready to serve.

""Amazing taste and for sure cheaper than buying it in a Thai restaurant,"" says Allrecipes home cook Seora Juarez. ""As suggested, go to a local Asian market to get your basil. It's a more authentic taste, but I've tried it with regular basil and it tastes good too. I like mine hot so I finely chop the peppers to make it spicy.""

""Amazing rendition of the classic Thai dish. I tend to use extra garlic and shallots. I use serrano chilies because traditional Thai chilies involve an extra grocery store. Otherwise make as directed. Perfect for family meals when I have the time to cook, and my kids love it,"" says reviewer Blair Dunn.

Allrecipes community member outdoorsgirl says, ""I love Thai food and do a lot of cooking. Kudos to Chef John for taking a Thai recipe and simplifying it so the average person can make a great dish! Substituting sweet soya instead of the regular soya and sugar works good too. The trick is a very hot wok ( hopefully) or skillet.""

You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:

This classic grilled cheese sandwich recipe calls for just white bread, sliced cheese, and butter. It's easy to switch up the bread and cheese to suit your taste preferences and, if you like, you can substitute mayonnaise for butter.

This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a wonderfully crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp Cheddar, mild Cheddar, or a blend of both. Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American cheese – it tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull.

Other delicious options are Gruyere, Brie, Fontina, Gouda, Pepper Jack, and havarti.

""My first grilled cheese and it was delicious,"" raves Chinwe Ogolo. ""I enjoyed the simplicity. Thank you for the recipe.""

""I learned in a restaurant that if you use a larger pan and leave the sandwich open in the pan on low heat to fry...the cheese will be melted perfectly and the outsides will be perfectly golden,"" according to Chandra Davidson.

""To make a GREAT sandwich awesome, just sprinkle some Parmesan cheese on the buttered bread before putting it into the skillet,"" says Sheri Cooper. ""WOW, what an upgrade in flavor.""

Editorial contributions by Corey Williams

Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.

Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.

To make hamburger patties, just mix the ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, evaporated milk, and spices and seasonings in a bowl using your hands.

The best way to season hamburger patties depends on personal taste. This top-rated recipe is seasoned with Worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper, and garlic. But you can get creative with what's in your spice cabinet — they're your burgers, after all.

It couldn't be easier to grill hamburger patties! You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

Prepare the grill grate by cleaning it and brushing it lightly with oil. Heat a charcoal or gas grill to medium-high heat, then grill the patties on each side (the length of time depends on the level of doneness you're after). If you're making cheeseburgers, add a slice of cheese about a minute before the burger is finished.

Hamburger patties are done when a food thermometer inserted into the center reaches 160 degrees F.

The only way to ensure that illness-causing bacteria has been destroyed is to make sure a food thermometer inserted into the center of the meat reaches 160 degrees F.

This recipe calls for about 4-5 minutes of grilling time on each side — that should get you into the safe-zone (you can use a thermometer to make sure).

Simple Beef Stroganoff,https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16311/simple-beef-stroganoff/,4,20,Dinner,4.1,"1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles
1 pound ground beef
1 (10.5 ounce) can fat-free condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 tablespoon garlic powder
½ cup sour cream
  salt and ground black pepper to taste","Homemade stroganoff doesn't have to be hard! This simple ground beef stroganoff comes together in 20 minutes with just six ingredients.

Beef stroganoff is an iconic Russian dish that consists of beef in a creamy sauce. According to legend, it was created by chefs who worked for the Stroganov family in the 1800s. The dish is often made with mushrooms and served over rice or egg noodles.

Traditional beef stroganoff is made with steak, a roux-based sauce, and sauteed mushrooms. But, as the title suggests, this recipe is simplified. It relies on shortcut ingredients, such as ground beef and canned cream of mushroom soup, to keep the cook time down and to cut down on extra steps.

You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what can you can expect when you make this ground beef stroganoff:

Saute ground beef until brown, then drain the fat. Add the canned soup and garlic powder. Simmer for about 10 minutes, then remove from heat. Stir cooked egg noodles and sour cream into the meat mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Since this ground beef stroganoff is a rather heavy dish, you may not need a side dish at all. A simple side salad, though, is a great way to round out your meal and to add a pop of color.

Of course, if you want something a little different, you could leave out the egg noodles and serve the ground beef and sauce mixture over white rice or mashed potatoes.

Store leftover beef stroganoff in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove.

Unfortunately, cooked egg noodles don't freeze well. If you'd like to freeze this ground beef stroganoff recipe, it's best to prepare it without the noodles. Freeze the beef-sauce mixture in a freezer-safe container for up to three months. Thaw on the stove and stir in cooked egg noodles before serving.

""My family loved this,"" says Amy Stewart. ""I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and added a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix, I think this is what made it so delicious! I also threw in a small can of mushrooms. Thanks for the recipe!""

""This recipe was quick and easy,"" raves one Allrecipes community member. ""It's a joy to be able to have a nice dinner on the table in about 30 minutes. This is one recipe that I will certainly use again and again.""

""This was really good,"" says Stephanie LeBlanc. ""I did make a few changes. I doubled the meat on this recipe and then used some beef broth with flour to cut down on the thickness. I also added a can of cream of onion soup to give it additional flavor.""

You'll also need shredded mozzarella.· Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).

Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

1. Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.2. Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.3. Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.4. Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.5. Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.

In an oven preheated to 375 degrees F, this homemade lasagna should be perfectly baked in about 50 minutes (30-40 minutes covered, 5-10 minutes uncovered).

Allow the homemade lasagna to cool completely, then transfer the leftovers to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to four days. Reheat in the oven or in the microwave.

If you plan to freeze lasagna, it's best to bake it in a foil pan. Allow it to cool completely, then tightly wrap the entire dish in storage wrap. Next, wrap it in at least one tight layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight and reheat in the oven or microwave.

""[This is] actually quite easy to make for someone who has never made lasagna before,"" according to jimbob2229. ""I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added spinach. Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make it again.""

""I didn't have any ground pork in the house, so I omitted that ingredient, but it was great with just the beef,"" says one Allrecipes community member. ""The sauce came out terrific too, much better than the stuff you find in jars.""

""I made this recipe last night and it turned out fabulous,"" raves Daniel Steed. ""I did increase the meats and sauce a little for the slightly larger pan size, but everyone loved it. I served it with garlic toast and green beans for a side.""

Editorial contributions by Corey Williams

Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.

Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.

While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.

While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.

Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.

Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.

Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.

Feel free to substitute ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese for a more traditional cheese filling. You can also add layers of veggies (such as spinach and mushrooms) when layering your lasagna.

1 (10 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed
1 tablespoon salt, or to taste
1 tablespoon ground black pepper, or to taste","It's easier than you think to make a perfect deep-fried turkey. Learn what you'll need, how long to deep fry a turkey, and get our best serving tips and side dish inspiration.

These are the ingredients you'll need to make this easy deep-fried turkey recipe:

· Oil: Peanut oil is perfect for frying, as it has a high smoke point and a neutral flavor.· Turkey: This recipe calls for a 10-pound turkey. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll have to adjust the cooking time.· Seasonings: This deep-fried turkey recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper. You can add more seasonings to taste.

You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this simple deep-fried turkey:

1. Prep: Make sure your stockpot or fryer is located outdoors in a safe area. Heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Cut any neck skin away from the thawed bird and make sure the neck hole is at least 1-inch in diameter.2. Season: Use a paper towel to pat the turkey dry. Season liberally with salt and pepper on the inside and outside.3. Fry: Place the turkey, neck-side down, in a drain basket. Gently lower the turkey into the hot oil until it's completely covered. Continue frying until the turkey is cooked through. Remove from the oil, drain, and allow to rest for 15 minutes before carving.

Fry your turkey for about 3.5 minutes per pound. For a 10-pound turkey, you'll fry for about 35 minutes. A meat thermometer inserted into the deepest part of the thigh should read 180 degrees F.

The beauty of this deep-fried turkey recipe is in its simplicity. There's no brining or marinating needed! However, you can brine the turkey before frying if you'd like. Consider Matt's Fried Turkey Brine — it's full of sweet and savory flavor that's impossible to resist.

Make sure your oil is heated to 350 degrees F throughout the cooking process. At this temperature, your 10-pound turkey should be done in about 35 minutes.

This deep-fried turkey will pair perfectly with all your holiday favorites, such as green bean casserole and cranberry sauce. Explore these mouthwatering collections for delicious inspiration:

Heat oil in a large stockpot or turkey fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make sure the fryer is located outdoors in a safe area, preferably on dirt or pavement, and far away from buildings, wooden decks, or other objects. Keep a fire extinguisher handy, just in case.

Ensure that the turkey is completely thawed. Cut any extra skin away from the neck area and make sure neck hole is at least 1 inch in diameter.

Pat the bird completely dry with paper towels, then rub liberally with salt and pepper on both the outside and the inside.

Place turkey into a drain basket, neck-side first. Working slowly and carefully, gently lower the basket into the hot oil to completely cover the turkey.

Maintain the temperature of the oil at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and cook turkey for 3 1/2 minutes per pound, about 35 minutes.

Carefully remove basket from oil, and drain turkey. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh; the internal temperature must be 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Allow to rest for 15 minutes before slicing.

We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount may vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used.

Roasted Rack of Lamb,https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/45641/roasted-rack-of-lamb/,4,45,Dinner,4.8,"½ cup fresh bread crumbs
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (7 bone) rack of lamb, trimmed and frenched
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard","This roasted rack of lamb recipe will impress even the toughest of critics.

You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:

These are the simple ingredients you’ll need to make this rack of lamb recipe at home:

Roast the rack of lamb in an oven preheated to 450 degrees F for 12 to 18 minutes, depending on how you like your meat cooked.

Tip from JENNINE1980: Allow the internal temperature to be 5 to 10 degrees less than you like because the meat will continue to cook while it sits.

Recipe creator JENNINE1980 suggests serving the roasted rack of lamb with Oven-Roasted Potatoes. For more delicious inspiration, explore our collection of Flavor-Packed Side Dish Recipes for Lamb.

“Quick and easy recipe, turned out perfect,” according to WSinc. “Worth it to mention: Don't waste what's left stuck to the pan and make a sauce out of it!”

“Very simple and really delicious,” raves IrishHarp. “I sautéed shallots before browning. Also when it was almost done I deglazed the pan with some good red wine. I removed the lamb and added one tablespoon of butter.”

“This recipe was delicious,” says sandrallaue. “The only thing I changed was I used dried thyme instead of fresh rosemary and it turned out wonderful. Very juicy and flavorful. The recipe was easy to follow.”

Editorial contributions by Corey Williams

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Move the oven rack to the center position.

Combine bread crumbs, garlic, rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl; stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil to moisten the mixture. Set aside.

Season rack of lamb all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat. Add lamb and sear on all sides, about 1 to 2 minutes: set lamb aside for a few minutes. Brush lamb with mustard and roll in bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. Cover the ends of the bones with foil to prevent charring.

Arrange the breaded rack of lamb bone-side down in the same skillet. Roast in preheated oven for 12 to 18 minutes for medium; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C), or continue to cook to desired doneness. Remove lamb from the skillet and allow to rest for 5 to 7 minutes, loosely covered with foil, before carving between the ribs.

Once complete, remove the beef roast and shred into hearty chunks. Put shredded beef chunks back into slow cooker and mix well.

Serve on top of “riced” cauliflower, mashed sweet potato, spaghetti squash, or eat plain like stew. The possibilities are endless",
