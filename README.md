# Hungroid is a minimum viable product creating automated meal plans personalized according to user inputs by scraping recipe websites such as AllRecipes and parsing MasterCook text files extracts
# My contribution was to 
# - Scrape 3 websites, and a text file for recipes (web_all_recipes.py)(txt_mastercook.py)
# - Create a common csv writer (df_csv_writer)
# - Merge all sources with the csv writer and the UI script
